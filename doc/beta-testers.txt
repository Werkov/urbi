Current release manager
#######################

The release manager for k2 beta is Samuel Tardieu <tardieu@gostai.com>.

Procedure
#########

To create an account for a beta-testers, you must be allowed to log into
www.gostai.com using the downloads account, by way of your SSH key.

Download area
#############

The download area is on www.gostai.com, ~downloads/urbi-sdk-2.0_beta, and
beta-testers can access it at http://www.gostai.com/downloads/urbi-sdk-2.0_beta

At this time, only the release manager is supposed to put new files online,
if other accesses are needed, just ask, and we may change this procedure.

Adding a beta-tester
####################

% ssh downloads@www.gostai.com ./allow_download urbi-sdk-2.0_beta <TESTER-EMAIL>

If the tester already exists, this will remind you of his password.

When creating a new beta-tester, please update the list below and the contact
information. This list will be used to send announces about new versions.

It is easiest for us to have one dedicated point of contact by
organization, but in some situations (e.g., student/advisor), having
several of them may be more appropriate.
