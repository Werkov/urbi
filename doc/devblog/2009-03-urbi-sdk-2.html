With Urbi 1 Gostai introduced a revolutionary means to program robots:
a domain specific scripting language that brings together the
efficiency of C++, and the flexibility of a dynamic language.  Urbi 1
was designed pragmatically, based on user requests and
feedback. That's how Urbi 1 was made useful, and how it met its users
expectations. Yet, because of this iterative design process, it
suffers a number of limitations.

We are happy to announce the first release candidate of Urbi 2, which
addresses these issues.  It is the result of an effort initiated by
Gostai last year.  Technical previews have been made available for
technical preview for months to our partners, therefore Urbi 2 already
runs on a large range of architectures which include the major PC
architectures (GNU/Linux x86 and ARM, Windows, Mac OS X x86 and PPC),
and robots (Aldebaran's Nao, Mechano's Skypee, Wowee's Rovio,
ActivMedia's Pioneer, etc.).

<h2>Some features of Urbi SDK 2</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Everything is an object.</strong>

    In the 1.x series there were several kinds of entities: numbers,
    lists, strings, images, etc. and objects.  In the 2.x series,
    everything is an object, including the atomic values.</li>

  <li><strong>Functions are first-class citizens.</strong>

    In other words, functions are objects and can be manipulated like
    any other type of object.  For instance you may copy a function
    from an object to another.</li>

  <li><strong>The distinction between value and function is blurred.</strong>

    From a software engineering point of view, the client (i.e., the
    "caller") should not know how the provider (i.e., the "callee") is
    implemented.  In particular, it is an implementation detail
    whether <tt>object.feature</tt> is an attribute, or a function
    taking no argument.  Therefore, parentheses are not needed to
    invoke functions that do not have argument (other
    that <tt>this</tt>)</li>

  <li><strong>Fewer primitives, more expressive power.</strong>

    The basic connectives, such
    as <tt>+</tt>, <tt>*</tt>, <tt>&lt;=</tt> and so forth, are
    regular functions that the user can freely define.  For
    instance <tt>Person.'&lt;' = function (rhs) { name &lt;
    rhs.name </tt>} defines the <tt>&lt;</tt>
    between <tt>Person</tt>.</li>

  <li><strong>Objects can be arbitrarily nested.</strong>

    Previous limitations of the language are alleviated, and
    the <tt>.</tt> (dot) connective can now be freely used.  For
    instance:[source language='c++']
    robot.leg("rear-left").joint("knee").value [/source]</li>

  <li><strong>Name spaces.</strong>

    There is no global name space in the Urbi language: there are no
    global variables or functions in the traditional sense.  Rather,
    the Urbi world is a network of objects that use each other (either
    via inheritance, or via aggregation).</li>

  <li><strong>Lobbies.</strong>

    Sessions with the Urbi server, via files or via network
    connections, are handled via "lobbies".  Lobbies implement the
    local scope: variables introduced during the interaction are only
    visible from this lobby.  Nevertheless, because lobbies are
    connected to the rest of the Urbi network of objects, the user can
    introduce new features in the common space, for instance by
    extending <tt>Object</tt>.  The user may also provide access to
    his/her own lobby by giving it a name in an object that is
    reachable from the other lobbies.</li>

  <li><strong>An object can have any number of prototypes.</strong>

    Multiple inheritance is fully supported.  This allows to factor
    common code.  For instance the object <tt>Orderable</tt> provides
    implementations of ordered comparators in terms of each other
    (e.g., <tt>function '&gt;=' (rhs) { rhs &lt; self </tt>}),
    and <tt>Comparable</tt> relates <tt>==</tt> and <tt>!=</tt>.  If
    your <tt>object</tt> provides <tt>==</tt> and <tt>&lt;</tt>, then
    running <tt>object.addProto(Comparable);object.addProto(Orderable);</tt>
    provides the others.</li>

  <li><strong>A richer, every growing, standard library</strong>

    Primitive values (Boolean, Float, String and so forth), Containers
    (Dictionary, List and others), programmatic entities (Pattern,
    Primitive, ...) and system objects (Channel, Event, Lobby, etc.)
    are provided.  It's a matter of minutes to extend the library!

  </li>

  <li><strong>A unified framework for UObjects</strong>

    Urbi can easily be extended with native entities written in some
    system language, say C++, thanks to the UObject technology.  While
    UObjects used to come in two flavors depending on their intended
    use (remote component, or code embedded in the server), they are
    today simple modules that can be launched in two different ways
    via a new tool, <tt>urbi-launch</tt>.

  </li>

  <li><strong>A rich set of convenient syntactic constructs</strong>

    Iterating a container is straightforward (<tt>for (var elt in
    list) echo (elt);</tt>), sending and receiving events is a matter
    of a few keystrokes (<tt>var release = Event.new; at
    (release?(version)) echo ("Urbi SDK " + version + " is
    released!"); release!("2.0");</tt>), <tt>try</tt>/<tt>catch</tt>
    provide support for exceptions, pattern matching is builtin,
    etc. etc.

  </li>

</ul>
