    This part covers the \urbi architecture: its core components
    (client/server architecture), how its middleware works, how to
    include extensions as UObjects (\Cxx components) and so forth.

    No knowledge of the \us language is needed.  As a matter of fact,
    \urbi can be used as a standalone middleware archicture to
    orchestrate the execution of existing components.

    Yet \us is a feature that ``comes for free'': it is easy using it
    to experiment, prototype, and even program fully-featured
    applications that orchestrate native components.  The interested
    reader should read either the \us user manual
    (\autoref{part:tut}), or the reference manual
    (\autoref{sec:lang}).

  \urbi \Cxx component using the UObject API.

  UObject architecture as a middleware.
