\section{Stream}

This is used to factor code between \refObject{InputStream} and
\refObject{OutputStream}.

\subsection{Prototypes}
\begin{refObjects}
\item[Object]
\end{refObjects}

\subsection{Construction}
\label{sec:specs:Stream:ctor}

Streams are not meant to be built, rather, use \refObject{InputStream} or
\refObject{OutputStream}.

When a stream (\refObject{OutputStream} or \refObject{InputStream}) is
opened on a \refObject{File}, that File cannot be removed.  On Unix systems,
this is handled gracefully (the references to the file are removed, but the
content is still there for the streams that were already bound to this
file); so in practice, the File appears to be removable.  On Windows, the
File cannot be removed at all.  Therefore, do not forget to close the
streams you opened.

\subsection{Slots}

\begin{urbiscriptapi}
\item[close] Flush the buffers, close \this, return \refObject{void}.  Raise
  an error \this is closed.
\begin{urbiscript}
var i = InputStream.new(File.create("file.txt"))|;
assert(i.close.isVoid);
i.close;
[00000001:error] !!! close: stream is closed

var o = OutputStream.new(File.create("file.txt"))|;
assert(o.close.isVoid);
o.close;
[00000002:error] !!! close: stream is closed
\end{urbiscript}

  The file is actually closed with \this is destroyed, if it was not already
  closed.


\item[closed] Whether \this is closed.
\begin{urbiassert}
var i = InputStream.new(File.create("file.txt"));

!i.closed;
i.close.isVoid;
i.closed;
\end{urbiassert}
\end{urbiscriptapi}
