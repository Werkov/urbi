\section{Boolean}

Booleans does not exist as a real type in \us. On the other hand, all
objects in \us can be evaluated as boolean value especially the two
specific object \lstinline|true| and \lstinline|false|.

\subsection{Prototypes}

As above, the prototype Boolean does not exists, but \lstinline|true|
and \lstinline|false| have the following prototype.

\begin{itemize}
\item \refObject{Singleton}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Construction}

Actually you don't want to construct booleans, you just want to know
if a condition is true or false. So the object \lstinline|true| and
\lstinline|false| are the result of all comparison statement.

\begin{urbiscript}
true;
[00000000] true
false;
[00000000] false
2 < 6;
[00000000] true
var x = true.new;
[00000000] true
x === true;
[00000000] true
\end{urbiscript}

As you can see, when you try to clone \lstinline|true| or
\lstinline|false|, you get the object itself and not a copy.
