\section{InputStream}

InputStreams are used to read (possibly binary) files by hand.
\refObject{File} provides means to swallow a whole file either as a
single large string, or a list of lines.  \lstinline|InputStream|
provides a more fine-grained interface to read files.

\subsection{Prototypes}
\begin{refObjects}
\item[Stream]
\end{refObjects}

\begin{windows}
  Beware that because of limitations in the current implementation,
  one cannot safely read from two different files at the same time
  under Windows.
\end{windows}

\subsection{Construction}

An InputStream is a reading-interface to a file, so its constructor
requires a \refObject{File}.

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
File.save("file.txt", "1\n2\n");
var is = InputStream.new(File.new("file.txt"));
[00000001] InputStream_0x827000
\end{urbiscript}

Bear in mind that open streams should be closed
(\autoref{sec:specs:Stream:ctor}).

\begin{urbiscript}
is.close;
\end{urbiscript}

\subsection{Slots}

\begin{urbiscriptapi}
\item[get]%
  Get the next available byte as a \refObject{Float}, or \refObject{nil} if
  the end of file was reached.  Raise an error if the file is closed.
\begin{urbiscript}
File.save("file.txt", "1\n2\n")|;
var i = InputStream.new(File.new("file.txt"))|;
var x;
while (!(x = i.get).isNil)
  cout << x;
[00000001:output] 49
[00000002:output] 10
[00000003:output] 50
[00000004:output] 10

i.close;

i.get;
[00000005:error] !!! get: stream is closed
\end{urbiscript}
\begin{urbicomment}
removeSlots("i", "x");
\end{urbicomment}


\item[getChar]%
  Get the next available byte as a \refObject{String}, or \refObject{nil}
  if the end of file was reached.  Raise an error if the file is closed.
\begin{urbiscript}
File.save("file.txt", "1\n2\n")|;
var i = InputStream.new(File.new("file.txt"))|;
var x;
while (!(x = i.getChar).isNil)
  cout << x;
[00000001:output] "1"
[00000002:output] "\n"
[00000003:output] "2"
[00000004:output] "\n"

i.close;

i.getChar;
[00000005:error] !!! getChar: stream is closed
\end{urbiscript}
\begin{urbicomment}
removeSlots("i", "x");
\end{urbicomment}


\item[getLine]%
  Get the next available line as a \refObject{String}, or \refObject{nil} if
  the end of file was reached.  The end-of-line characters are trimmed.
  Raise an error if the file is closed.
\begin{urbiscript}
File.save("file.txt", "1\n2\n")|;
var i = InputStream.new(File.new("file.txt"))|;
var x;
while (!(x = i.getLine).isNil)
  cout << x;
[00000001:output] "1"
[00000002:output] "2"

i.close;

i.getLine;
[00000005:error] !!! getLine: stream is closed
\end{urbiscript}
\begin{urbicomment}
removeSlots("i", "x");
\end{urbicomment}
\end{urbiscriptapi}
