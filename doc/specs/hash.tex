\section{Hash}

A \dfn{hash} is a condensed, easily comparable representation of
another value. They are mainly used to map \refObject{Dictionary} keys
to values.

Equal objects must always have the same hash. Different objects
should, as much as possible, have different hashes.

\subsection{Prototypes}
\begin{refObjects}
\item[Object]
\end{refObjects}

\subsection{Construction}
Objects can be hashed with \refSlot[Object]{hash}.
\begin{urbiassert}
Object.new.hash.isA(Hash);
\end{urbiassert}

\subsection{Slots}
\begin{urbiscriptapi}
\item[asFloat] A Float value equivalent to the \lstinline|Hash|
  object. Two hashes have the same Float representation if and only if
  they are equal.
\item[combine](<other>) combine \var{other}'s hash with \var{this},
  and return \var{this}. This is used to hash composite objects based
  on more primitive object hashes. For instance, an object with two
  slots could be hashed by hashing its first first, and combining the
  second in.

\begin{urbiscript}
class C
{
  function init(var a, var b)
  {
    var this.a = a;
    var this.b = b;
  };

  function hash()
  {
    this.a.hash().combine(b)
  };
}|

assert
{
  C.new(0, 0).hash == C.new(0, 0).hash;
  C.new(0, 0).hash != C.new(0, 1).hash;
};
\end{urbiscript}
\end{urbiscriptapi}
