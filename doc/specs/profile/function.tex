\section{Profile.Function}

A \lstinline|Function| object contains information about calls of a
given function during a profiling operation.

\subsection{Prototypes}

\begin{refObjects}
\item[Object]
\end{refObjects}

\subsection{Construction}

\lstinline|Function| objects are not meant to be cloned as they are
created by \refSlot[System]{profile} internal machinery.

\begin{urbiscript}
System.profile(function() { echo("foo") }).calls[6];
[00000002] *** foo
[00000001] Function('echo', 1, 0.000181, 181)
\end{urbiscript}

\subsection{Slots}

\begin{urbiscriptapi}

\item[calls]%
  The number of times this function was called during the profiling.

\item[name]%
  The name of the function called.

\item[selfTimePer]%
  Average CPU time spent in one function call. It is computed as the ratio
  of \refSlot{selfTime} divided by \refSlot{calls}.

\item[selfTime]%
  Total CPU time spent in all calls of the function.

\end{urbiscriptapi}
