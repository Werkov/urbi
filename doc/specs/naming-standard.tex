\chapter{\urbi Readyâ„¢-Certification Standard}
\label{sec:naming}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=.5]{img/urbi-ready}
\end{center}

% \section{Introduction}

This section aims at clarifying the naming conventions in \urbi
Engines for standard hardware/software devices and components
implemented as UObject and the corresponding methods/attributes/events
to access them. The list of available hardware types and software
component is increasing and this document will be updated
accordingly. Please contact us directly, should you be working on a
component not described or closely related to one described here:

\begin{center}
  \email{standard@gostai.com}
\end{center}

Any implementation of an \urbi server must comply with the latest
version of this standard to get the ``\urbi ready'' certification from
Gostai S.A.S.


Gostai S.A.S. is currently the only authority which has the ability to
deliver an ``\urbi Ready'' certification.

``\urbi Ready'' and the associated logo are trademarks of Gostai
S.A.S. and should not be used or displayed in any way without an
explicit written agreement from Gostai.

\section{The Structure Tree}

The robot will be described as a set of \textit{components} organized
in a hierarchical structure called the \textit{structure tree}. The
relationship between a component and a sub-component in the tree is a
`part-of' inclusion relationship. From the point of view of \urbi,
each component in the tree is an object, and it contains attributes
pointing to its sub-components. Here is a example illustrating a part
of a hierarchy that could be found with a humanoid robot:

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{img/structure-tree}
\end{center}

The leaves of the tree are called \textit{devices}, and they usually
match physical devices in the robot: motors, sensors, lights, camera,
etc. Inside \urbi, the various objects corresponding to the tree
components are accessed by following the path of objects inclusions,
like in the example below (shortcuts will be described later):

\begin{urbifixme}
body.legR.hip.tilt;
body.legL.knee.led;
body.legL.hip;
// ...
\end{urbifixme}


The structure tree should not be mistaken for a representation of the
kinematics chain of the robot. The kinematics chain is built from a
subset of the devices corresponding to motor devices, and it
represents spatial connections between them. Except for these motor
devices, the structure tree components do not have a direct
counterpart in the kinematics chain, or, if they do, it is as a subset
of the kinematics chain (for example, \code{legR} is a subset of the
whole kinematics chain).


The goal of this standard is to provide guidelines on how to define
the components and the structure tree, knowing the kinematics chain of
the robot.

\section{Frame of Reference}

In many cases, it will be necessary to refer to an absolute frame of
reference attached to the robot body. To avoid ambiguities, the
standard frame of reference will have the following definition:

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{img/reference-frame}
\end{center}

\begin{description}
\item[Origin] the center of mass of the robot
\item[X axis] oriented towards the front of the robot. If there is a
  camera, the front is defined by the default direction of the camera,
  otherwise the front will be seen as the natural frontal orientation
  for a mobile robot (the direction of ``forward'' movement). If the
  robot is not naturally oriented, the X axis will be chosen to match
  the main axis of symmetry of the robot body and it will be oriented
  towards the smallest side, typically the top of a cone for
  example. In case of a perfectly symmetrical body, the X axis can be
  chosen arbitrarily but a clear mark should be made visible on the
  robot body to indicate it.
\item[Z axis] oriented in the opposite direction from the gravity. If
  there is no gravity or natural up/down orientation in the
  environment or normal operation mode of the robot, the Z axis should
  be chosen in the direction of the main axis of symmetry in the
  orthogonal plane defined by the X axis, oriented towards the
  smallest side. In case of a perfectly symmetrical plane, the Z axis
  can be chosen arbitrarily but a clear mark should be made visible on
  the robot body to indicate it.
\item[Y axis] oriented to make a right-handed coordinate system.
\end{description}


The axes are oriented in a counter-clockwise direction, as depicted in
the illustration above.

\section{Component naming}

The name of a component A, which is a sub-component of component B, is
divided into two parts: the generic designation of a subpart of the
kinematics chain (like ``leg'', ``head'', ``finger'') that A is referring
to, and optionally some topological disambiguator relative to its
position within the component B it belongs to. For example, when there
are two legs, we need to differentiate between the right and left leg,
relative to the body component they belong to. The first part is
called the \textit{designation}, and the second optional part is
called the \textit{localization}.

\paragraph{Designation}


The designation of a component is a usually robot-specific and depends
on the class of the robot (wheeled, humanoid, animaloid, etc). We will
give in the following chapters some guidelines for the most current
designations, and we will give more advanced rules for rare customized
cases.


The designation is the critical part of the naming standard. We cannot
possibly cover all future configurations and conceivable robot complex
bodies, but the current document will grow whenever we find a new
case.  We hope to be already covering most of the main cases you can
find in the industry.

\paragraph{Localization}

Localization is necessary when there are two identical sub-components
A1 and A2 belonging to the same component B, like for example two legs
or two arms attached to the main body. Usually this can be sorted out
with simple geometric qualifiers like \textit{Right/Center/Left},
\textit{Front/Middle/Back} or \textit{Up/In-between/Down}. The naming
convention is to use the first letter of the geometric characteristic,
like R for Right, I for In-between.  Note that ``right'' or ``front'' are
understood here from the point of view of a man standing and looking
in the direction of the X-axis of the robot, and \textit{Up/Down}
matches the Z-axis, as depicted in the figure below:

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{img/cube}
\end{center}

Several geometric qualifiers can be used at the same time to further
refine the position. As a convention, side information comes first
(R/C/L), followed by the depth information (F/M/H) and then the height
information (U/I/D).

You can further qualify a side+depth localization with an additional
R/L side information. This can be used in the typical layout below:

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{img/lrfh}
\end{center}

This dual positioning using side+depth can also be used to combine
side+height or height+depth information.

Some layouts will typically imply a bilateral organization like for
example an insectoid robot with a series of 3 legs on both side of its
body. In that case, an array will be used and follow the geometrical
localization (R/L). The smaller the number, the closer to the front:
R[1], R[2], R[3] and L[1], L[2], L[3]. This can be used when there is
at least 3 components on each side, otherwise the
\textit{Front}/\textit{Back} approach prevails.

Some components like spines or tails are highly articulated with a set
of identical sub-components. When talking about these sub-components,
the above localization should be replaced by an array with a numbering
starting at 0. The smaller the number, the closer the sub-component is
to the robot main body. For surface-like sub-components, like skin
touch sensors, the array can be two dimensional.

Other possible localization for sensors are the X, Y and Z axis
themselves, like for example for an accelerometer or a gyro sensor,
available in each of the three directions.


Examples of component names including localization:

\begin{urbifixme}
legR, legL, armR, armL;
fingerR, fingerC, fingerL;      // three-finger hand
joint[0], joint[1] ... joint[5] // from tail
touch[478][124]                 // from skin
accelX, accelY, accelZ;         // typical accelerometer
gyroX, gyroY, gyroZ;            // typical gyro sensor
\end{urbifixme}

\section{Facets}

\urbi allows multiple inheritances between objects. This feature can be
used to introduce the notion of ``facet''. A facet is an object in \urbi
that describes some aspect of a type of component.

For example, for a joint, we can have a ``swivel'' facet, used to define
patella joints. For the robot body itself, we have a ``mobile'' facet
describing mobile robots, which includes some standard way of
requesting a move forward, a turn, etc. A robot with a Pan/Tilt camera
or otherwise moving camera will have the ``panoramic'' facet which is
abstracting the way the robot can turn its gaze in any direction.

In short, facets are standard Urbi objects that components can inherit
from to acquire some functionalities, expressed as a standard
interface. We will describe in the following pages a few of the most
standard facets. Each facet should be reimplemented for any particular
robot that uses them, for example the ``mobile'' facet will have a
completely different implementation with a humanoid robot and a wheeled
robot.

\facet{blobDetector}

Ball detectors, marker detectors and various feature-based detectors
should all share a similar interface. They extract a part of the image
that fits some criteria and define a \dfn{blob} accordingly. Here are

  {%
    The language used, in international notation (fr, en, itâ€¦): ISO
    639%

  {%
    The language used, in international notation (fr, en, itâ€¦): ISO
    639%
  }
\end{slots}

\begin{slots}[Events]
  \slot{hear(s)}%
  {%
    This event has one parameter which is the string describing what
    the speech engine has recognized (can be a word or a sentence).%
  }
\end{slots}

\section{Standard Components}

Standard components correspond to components typically found in wheeled
robots, humanoid or animaloid robots, or in industrial arms.

The table on the next pages summarize the currently referenced standard
components, with a description of potential components that they could
be subcomponent of, a description of potential components they may
contain, and a list of relevant facets. This table should be seen as a
quick reference guide to identify available components in a given
robot.

\subsection{Yaw/Pitch/Roll orientation}
\label{sec:naming:ypr}

It is not always clear which rotational direction corresponds to the
yaw, pitch or roll components (listed in the table below). This is a
quick guideline to help determine the proper association.

Let us consider the robot in its resting, most prototypical position,
like ``standing'' on two or four legs for a humanoid or animaloid, and
let all members ``naturally'' fall under gravity. When gravity has no
effect on a certain joint (because it is in the orthogonal plan to Z,
for example), the medium position between rangemin and rangemax should
be used. The body position achieved will be considered as a reference.
Then for each component that is described in terms of yaw/pitch/roll
sub-decomposition, the association will be as follow:

\begin{description}
\item[yaw] rotational articulation around the Z axis in the robot.
\item[pitch] rotational articulation around the Y axis in the robot.
\item[roll] rotational articulation around the X axis in the robot.
\end{description}

When there is no exact match with the X/Y/Z axis, the closest match, or
the default remaining available axis, should be selected to determine
the yaw/pitch/roll meaning.

\section{Compact notation}

Components are usually identified with their full-length name, which is
the path to access them inside the structure tree. For convenience and
backward compatibility with pre-2.0 versions of \urbi, there is also a
compact notation available. We will describe here how to construct the
compact notation starting from the full name and the structure tree.

\tablehead{\hline
Full name &
Compact name\\\hline}
\begin{supertabular}{|m{9.008cm}|m{5.533cm}|}
\code{robot.body.armR.elbow} &
\code{elbowR} \\\hline
\code{robot.body.head.yaw} &
\code{headYaw} \\\hline
\code{robot.body.legL.knee.pitch} &
\code{kneeL} \\\hline
\code{robot.body.armR.hand.finger[3][2]} &
\code{fingerR[3][2]} \\\hline
\code{robot.body.armL.hand.fingerR} &
\code{fingerLR} \\\hline
\end{supertabular}

The rule is to move every localization qualifier at the end of the
compact notation, in the order where they appear in the full-length
name. The remaining component names should then be considered one by
one to see if they are needed to remove ambiguities. If they are not,
like typically the robot or body components which are shared with
almost every other full-length name, they can be ignored. If finally
several component names have to be kept, they should be separated by
using upper case letters for the first character instead of a dot, like
in Java-style notation.

\begin{example}[\code{robot.body.armL.hand.fingerR}]~\\
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Move all localization at the end:
    \code{robot.body.arm.hand.fingerLR}
  \item The fullname remaining is: \code{robot.body.arm.hand.finger}
  \item \code{finger} should be kept, \code{hand}, \code{arm},
    \code{body} and \code{robot} are not necessary since every
    finger component will always be attached only to a hand, itself
    attached to an arm and a body and a robot.
  \item The result is \code{fingerLR}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}


\begin{example}[\code{robot.body.head.yaw}]~\\
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item No localization to move
  \item \code{yaw} must be kept because \code{head} also have a
    \code{pitch} subcomponent and
  \item \code{head} must also be kept to avoid ambiguity with other
    components having a \code{yaw} subcomponent.
  \item The result is \code{headYaw}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\begin{example}[\code{robot.body.legL.knee.pitch}]~\\
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Move all localization at the end:
    \code{robot.body.leg.knee.pitchL}
  \item \code{pitch} is not necessary because \code{knee} has only a
    \code{pitch}, so \code{knee} will be kept only
  \item The result is \code{kneeL}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}
