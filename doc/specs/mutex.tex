\section{Mutex}

\dfn{Mutex} allow to define critical sections.

\subsection{Prototypes}
\begin{itemize}
\item \refObject{Tag}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Construction}
A Mutex can be constructed like any other Tag but without name.

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
var m = Mutex.new;
[00000000] Mutex_0x964ed40
\end{urbiscript}

You can define critical sections by tagging your code using the Mutex.

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
var m = Mutex.new |
m: echo("this is critical section");
[00000001] *** this is critical section
\end{urbiscript}

As a critical section, two pieces of code tagged by the same ``Mutex''
will never be executed at the same time.
