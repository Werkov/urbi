\section{Directory}

A \dfn{Directory} represents a directory of the file system.

\subsection{Prototypes}
\begin{refObjects}
\item[Object]
\end{refObjects}

\subsection{Construction}

A \dfn{Directory} can be constructed with one argument: the path of
the directory using a \refObject{String} or a \refObject{Path}. It can
also be constructed by the method open of \refObject{Path}.

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
Directory.new(".");
[00000001] Directory(".")
Directory.new(Path.new("."));
[00000002] Directory(".")
\end{urbiscript}

\subsection{Slots}
\begin{urbiscriptapi}
\item[asList]
  The contents of the directory as a \refObject{Path} list.  The
  various paths include the name of the directory \lstinline|this|.

\item[content]
  The contents of the directory as a \refObject{String} list.  The
  strings include only the last component name; they do not contain
  the directory name of \lstinline|this|.

\item \lstinline|fileCreated(\var{name)|\\
  Event launched when a file is created inside the directory.

\begin{urbiscript}
{
  var d = Directory.new(".");

  // watch the fileCreated event.
  at (d.fileCreated?(var name))
    echo("File '%s' created inside '%s'." % [name, d]);
}
&
  // Create a file to launch the fileCreated event.
  File.create("./dummy-file.txt");
[00000001] *** File 'dummy-file.txt' created inside '.'.
\end{urbiscript}

\item \lstinline|fileDeleted(\var{name)|\\
  Event launched when a file is deleted from the directory.

\begin{urbiscript}
{
  var d = Directory.new(".");

  at (d.fileDeleted?(var name))
    echo("File '%s' deleted from '%s'." % [name, d]);
}
&
  // Remove a file to launch the fileDeleted event.
  File.new("./dummy-file.txt").remove;
[00000001] *** File 'dummy-file.txt' deleted from '.'.
\end{urbiscript}


\end{urbiscriptapi}
