\section{System}
Details on the architecture the \urbi server runs on.

\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline'_exit(\var{status})'\\
  Shut the server down brutally: the connections are not closed, and
  the resources are not explicitly released (the operating system
  reclaims most of them: memory, file descriptors and so forth).
  Architecture dependent.

\item \lstinline'Platform'\\
  See \refObject{System.Platform}

\item \lstinline'loadLibrary(\var{library})'\\
  Load the library \var{library}, to be found in the
  \env{URBI\_UOBJECT\_PATH} search-path (see
  \autoref{sec:tools:envvars}).  The \var{library} may be a
  \refObject{String} or a \refObject{Path}.  The \Cxx symbols are made
  available to the other \Cxx components.  See also
  \lstinline|loadModule|.

\item \lstinline'loadModule(\var{module})'\\
  Load the UObject \var{module}.  Same as \lstinline|loadLibrary|,
  except that the low-level \Cxx symbols are not made ``global'' (in
  the sense of the shared library loader).

\item \lstinline'reboot'\\
  Restart the \urbi server.  Architecture dependent.

\item \lstinline'shutdown'\\
  Have the \urbi server shut down.  All the connections are closed,
  the resources are released.  Architecture dependent.
\end{itemize}
