\section{System}
Details on the architecture the \urbi server runs on.

\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline'_exit(\var{status})'\\
  Shut the server down brutally: the connections are not closed, and
  the resources are not explicitly released (the operating system
  reclaims most of them: memory, file descriptors and so forth).
  Architecture dependent.

\item \lstinline'Platform'\\
  See \refObject{System.Platform}

\item \lstinline'reboot'\\
  Restart the \urbi server.  Architecture dependent.

\item \lstinline'shutdown'\\
  Have the \urbi server shut down.  All the connections are closed,
  the resources are released.  Architecture dependent.
\end{itemize}
