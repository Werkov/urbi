\section{Event}

An \dfn{event} can be ``emitted'' and ``caught'', or ``sent'' and
``received''.  See also \autoref{sec:tut:events}.

\subsection{Prototypes}
\begin{itemize}
\item \refObject{Object}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Examples}

There are several examples of uses of events in the documentation of
event-based constructs.  See \lstinline{at} (\autoref{sec:lang:at}),
\lstinline{waituntil} (\autoref{sec:lang:waituntil}),
\lstinline{whenever} (\autoref{sec:lang:whenever}), and so forth.  The
tutorial chapter about event-based programming contains other
examples, see \autoref{sec:tut:event-prog}.

\subsection{Construction}

An \lstinline{Event} is created like any other object, without
arguments.

\begin{urbiscript}
var e = Event.new;
[00000001] Event_0x9ad8118
\end{urbiscript}

\subsection{Slots}
\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline|asEvent|\\
  Return \lstinline|this|.

\item \lstinline|'emit'|\\
  Throw an \lstinline|Event|. This function is called by the bang
  operator.  It takes any number of arguments, passed to the receiver
  when the event is caught. An event can also be emitted for a certain
  duration using \lstinline|~|.  The execution of \lstinline|at|
  clauses etc., is asynchronous: the control flow might be released by
  the \lstinline|emit| call before all the watchers have finished
  their execution.

\item \lstinline|syncEmit|\\
  Throw a synchronized event. This call awaits that all functions that
  have to react to this event have returned.  This function can have
  the same arguments as \lstinline|emit|.

\item \lstinline|trigger|\\
  This function is used to launch an event during an unknown amount of
  time. Calling this function launches and keeps the event triggered
  and returns an object whose \lstinline|stop| method stops launching
  the event.
