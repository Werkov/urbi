How to report bugs for Urbi 2.0 beta ?

Bug reports should be sent to "k2-beta@lists.gostai.com". This address
reaches the kernel team and will be addressed as fast as possible.

Each bug report should contain a self-contained example, which can
be tested by our team. Using self-contained code, that is code which
does not depend on other code, helps ensuring that we will be able
to duplicate the problem and analyze it promptly. It will also helps
us integrating the code snippet into our non-regression test suite
so that the bug does not reappear in the future.

If it appears that your report identifies a bug in the Urbi kernel
or its dependencies, we will prepare a fix to be integrated in a
later release. If the bug takes some time to fix, we may provide you
with a workaround so that your developments are not delayed.

In your bug report, make sure that you indicate the Urbi version you
are using (use "urbi-console --version" to check it out) and whether
this bug is blocking you or not. Also, please keep "k2-beta@lists.gostai.com"
in copy of all your correspondance, and do not reply individually
to a member of our team as this may slow down the handling of the
report.
