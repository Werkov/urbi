\begin{partDescription}{part:tut}
  {%
    This part is the \us user manual, also sometimes referred to as
    the ``\us tutorial''.  It teaches the reader how to program in
    \us.  It goes from the installation steps up to concurrent and
    event-based programming.  No specific knowledge is expected.
    There is no need for a \Cxx compiler, as \UObject will not be
    covered here (see \autoref{part:uobject}).  The reference manual
    contains a terse and complete definition of the \urbi environment
    (\autoref{part:specs}).
