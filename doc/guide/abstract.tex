  Based on our own experience, and code that users have submitted to us, we
  suggest a programming guideline for \usdk.
\item[sec:k1] This chapter is intended to people who want to migrate
  programs in \us 1 to \us 2.
\item[sec:build] Building \usdk from the sources.  How to install it,

  want to \emph{build} \usdk, which is orders of magnitude more delicate
  than simply installing the binary packages from Gostai.
