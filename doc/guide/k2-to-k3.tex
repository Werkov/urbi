\chapter{Migration from urbiscript 2 to urbiscript 3}

This chapter describes the changes needed to make \us code written for
\us 2 work in the \us 3 interpreter.

\section{Automatic function evaluation without parenthesis}

The most visible change from \us 2 to \us 3 is that functions are no
longuer called when parenthesis are ommited. The function itself is
returned instead.

So one must add missing parenthesis around all function calls, or convert
functions with no arguments to properties (\ref{sec:tut:getter}) where
appropriate.

To help you track function calls missing parenthesis, you can define
the environment variable URBI\_REPORT\_MISSING\_PAREN.

% We use urbiunchecked because env variable must be set at startup.
\begin{urbiunchecked}
function f() {1};
[00004397] function () { 1 }
f; // In urbiscript 2 this would have called f
[  Urbi.Compatibility   ] Maybe missing parens at 2.1
[00005092] function () { 1 }
\end{urbiunchecked}

This will produce false positives in the \us standard library that you can
safely ignore, and false positives in \us 3 code.

\section{getSlot and setSlot}

Since \refObject{Slot}s are now exposed in urbiscript, the \us 2
\refSlot[Slot]{getSlot} and \refSlot[Slot]{setSlot} have been renamed to
\refSlot[Slot]{getSlotValue} and \refSlot[Slot]{setSlotValue}.
