\section[Introduction]{Introduction}
{
\textsf{This document aims at clarifying the naming convention}\textsf{s
in URBI Engines for standard hardware/software devices and components
implemented as }UObject\textsf{ and the corresponding
methods/attributes/events to access them. The list of available
hardware types and software component is increasing and this document
will be updated accordingly. Please contact us directly, should you be
working on a component not described or closely related to one
described here:}}

Any implementation of an URBI server must comply with the latest version
of this standard to get the {\textquotedbl}URBI ready{\textquotedbl}
certification from Gostai S.A.S.


Gostai S.A.S. is currently the only authority which has the ability to
deliver an {\textquotedbl}URBI Ready{\textquotedbl} certification.

\section[The Structure Tree]{The Structure
Tree}
{
\textsf{The robot will be described as a set of
}\textsf{\textit{components}}\textsf{ organized in a hierarchical
structure called the }\textsf{\textit{structure tree}}\textsf{. The
relationship between a component and a sub-component in the tree is a
‘part-of’ inclusion relationship. From the point of view of URBI, each
component in the tree is an object, and it contains attributes pointing
to its sub-components. Here is a example illustrating a part of a
hierarchy that could be found with a humanoid robot:}}



\begin{figure}
\centering
%\includegraphics[width=10.146cm,height=5.683cm]{namingstandard-img/namingstandard-img3.pdf}
\end{figure}
{
\textsf{The leaves of the tree are called
}\textsf{\textit{devices}}\textsf{, and they usually match physical
devices in the robot: motors, sensors, lights, camera, etc. Inside
URBI, the various objects corresponding to the tree components are
accessed by following the path of objects inclusions, like in the
example below (shortcuts will be described later):}}

{
body.legR.hip.tilt}

{
body.legL.knee.led}

{
body.legL.hip}

{
…}


The structure tree should not be mistaken for a representation of the
kinematics chain of the robot. The kinematics chain is built from a
subset of the devices corresponding to motor devices, and it represents
spatial connections between them. Except for these motor devices, the
structure tree components do not have a direct counterpart in the
kinematics chain, or, if they do, it is as a subset of the kinematics
chain (for example, \texttt{legR} is a subset of the whole kinematics
chain).


The goal of this standard is to provide guidelines on how to define the
components and the structure tree, knowing the kinematics chain of the
robot.

\section[Frame of Reference]{Frame of
Reference}

In many cases, it will be necessary to refer to an absolute frame of
reference attached to the robot body. To avoid ambiguities, the
standard frame of reference will have the following definition:



\begin{figure}
\centering
 [Warning: Image ignored] % Unhandled or unsupported graphics:
%%\includegraphics[width=7.458cm,height=7.1cm]{}

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item {
\textsf{\textbf{Origin}}\textsf{: the center of mass of the robot}}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item {
\textsf{\textbf{X axis}}\textsf{: oriented towards the front of the
robot. If there is a camera, the front is defined by the default
direction of the camera, otherwise the front will be seen as the
natural frontal orientation for a mobile robot (the direction of
“forward” movement). If the robot is not naturally oriented, the X axis
will be chosen to match the main axis of symmetry of the robot body and
it will be oriented towards the smallest side, typically the top of a
cone for example. }\textsf{In case of a perfectly symmetrical body, the
X axis can be chosen arbitrarily but a clear mark should be made
visible on the robot body to indicate it.}}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item {
\textsf{\textbf{Z axis}}\textsf{: oriented in the opposite direction
from the gravity. If there is no gravity or natural up/down orientation
in the environment or normal operation mode of the robot, the Z axis
should be chosen in the direction of the main axis of symmetry in the
orthogonal plane defined by the X axis, oriented towards the smallest
side. In case of a perfectly symmetrical plane, the Z axis can be
chosen arbitrarily but a clear mark should be made visible on the robot
body to indicate it.}}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item {
\textsf{\textbf{Y axis}}\textsf{: oriented to make a right-handed
coordinate system. }}
\end{itemize}

The axes are oriented in a counter-clockwise direction, as depicted in
the illustration above.

\section[Component naming]{Component naming}
{
\textsf{The name of a component A, which is a sub-component of component
B, is divided into two parts: the generic designation of a subpart of
the kinematics chain (like ‘leg’, ‘head’, ‘finger’) that A is referring
to, and optionally some topological disambiguator relative to its
position within the component B it belongs to. For example, when there
are two legs, we need to differentiate between the right and left leg,
relative to the body component they belong to. The first part is called
the }\textsf{\textit{designation}}\textsf{, and the second optional
part is called the }\textsf{\textit{localization}}\textsf{.}}

\paragraph{Designation}


The designation of a component is a usually robot-specific and depends
on the class of the robot (wheeled, humanoid, animaloid, etc). We will
give in the following chapters some guidelines for the most current
designations, and we will give more advanced rules for rare customized
cases.


The designation is the critical part of the naming standard. We cannot
possibly cover all future configurations and conceivable robot complex
bodies, but the current document will grow whenever we find a new case.
We hope to be already covering most of the main cases you can find in
the industry.

\paragraph{Localization }

{
\textsf{Localization is necessary when there are two identical
sub-components A1 and A2 belonging to the same component B, like for
example two legs or two arms attached to the main body. Usually this
can be sorted out with simple geometric qualifiers like
}\textsf{\textit{Right/Center/Left}}\textsf{,
}\textsf{\textit{Front/Middle/Back}}\textsf{ or
}\textsf{\textit{Up}}\textsf{\textit{/In-between/Down}}\textsf{. The
naming convention is to use the first letter of the geometric
characteristic, like }R\textsf{ for Right, }I\textsf{ for In-between.
Note that “right” or “front” are understood here from the point of view
of a man standing and looking in the direction of the X-axis of the
robot, and
}\textsf{\textit{Up}}\textsf{/}\textsf{\textit{Down}}\textsf{ matches
the Z-axis, as depicted in the figure below:}}

{\centering [Warning: Draw object ignored][Warning: Draw object
ignored]\par}

{
\textsf{Several geometric qualifiers can be used at the same time to
further refine the position. As a convention, side information comes
first (}R\textsf{/}C\textsf{/}L\textsf{), followed by the depth
information (}F\textsf{/}M\textsf{/}H\textsf{) and then the height
information (}U\textsf{/}I\textsf{/}D\textsf{). }}


You can further qualify a side+depth localization with an additional R/L
side information. This can be used in the typical layout below:

{\centering
%\includegraphics[width=8.819cm,height=8.819cm]{namingstandard-img/namingstandard-img4.jpg}
\par}


This dual positioning using side+depth can also be used to combine
side+height or height+depth information.


Some layouts will typically imply a bilateral organization like for
example an insectoid robot with a series of 3 legs on both side of its
body. In that case, an array will be used and follow the geometrical
localization (R/L). The smaller the number, the closer to the front:
R[1], R[2], R[3] and L[1], L[2], L[3]. This can be used when there is
at least 3 components on each side, otherwise the
\textit{Front}/\textit{Back} approach prevails.


Some components like spines or tails are highly articulated with a set
of identical sub-components. When talking about these sub-components,
the above localization should be replaced by an array with a numbering
starting at 0. The smaller the number, the closer the sub-component is
to the robot main body. For surface-like sub-components, like skin
touch sensors, the array can be two dimensional.


Other possible localization for sensors are the X, Y and Z axis
themselves, like for example for an accelerometer or a gyro sensor,
available in each of the three directions.


Examples of component names including localization:

{
legR, legL, armR, armL}

{
fingerR, fingerC, fingerL // three fingers hand}

{
joint[0], joint[1] … joint[5] // from tail}

{
touch[478][124] // from skin}

{
accelX, accelY, accelZ // typical accelerometer}

{
gyroX, gyroY, gyroZ // tpycial gyro sensor}

\section[Facets]{Facets}

URBI allows multiple inheritances between objects. This feature can be
used to introduce the notion of “facet”. A facet is an object in URBI
that describes some aspect of a type of component.


For example, for a joint, we can have a “swivel” facet, used to define
patella joints. For the robot body itself, we have a “mobile” facet
describing mobile robots, which includes some standard way of
requesting a move forward, a turn, etc. A robot with a Pan/Tilt camera
or otherwise moving camera will have the “panoramic” facet which is
abstracting the way the robot can turn its gaze in any direction.


In short, facets are standard Urbi objects that components can inherit
from to acquire some functionalities, expressed as a standard
interface. We will describe in the following pages a few of the most
standard facets. Each facet should be reimplemented for any particular
robot that uses them, for example the “mobile” facet will have a
completely different implementation with a humanoid robot and a wheeled
robot.

Speech recognition allows to transform a stream of sound into a text
using various speech recognition algorithms. Default implementations
should use the \texttt{micro} component (or alias) as their default
sound input.

\section[Standard Components]{Standard
Components}

Standard components correspond to components typically found in wheeled
robots, humanoid or animaloid robots, or in industrial arms.


The table on the next pages summarize the currently referenced standard
components, with a description of potential components that they could
be subcomponent of, a description of potential components they may
contain, and a list of relevant facets. This table should be seen as a
quick reference guide to identify available components in a given
robot.

\paragraph{Yaw/Pitch/Roll orientation: guideline}


It is not always clear which rotational direction corresponds to the
yaw, pitch or roll components (listed in the table below). This is a
quick guideline to help determine the proper association.


Let us consider the robot in its resting, most prototypical position,
like “standing” on two or four legs for a humanoid or animaloid, and
let all members “naturally” fall under gravity. When gravity has no
effect on a certain joint (because it is in the orthogonal plan to Z,
for example), the medium position between rangemin and rangemax should
be used. The body position achieved will be considered as a reference.
Then for each component that is described in terms of yaw/pitch/roll
sub-decomposition, the association will be as follow:

{
\textsf{\textbf{ yaw}}\textsf{ : rotational articulation around the Z
axis in the robot.}}


\textbf{ pitch} : rotational articulation around the Y axis in the
robot.


\textbf{ roll} : rotational articulation around the X axis in the
robot.


When there is no exact match with the X/Y/Z axis, the closest match, or
the default remaining available axis, should be selected to determine
the yaw/pitch/roll meaning.

\sffamily This is the main component that
contains every piece of hardware in the robot. This includes all
primary kinematics sub-chains (arms, legs, neck, head, etc) and

leg &
\sffamily Legs are found in humanoid or
animaloid robots and correspond to part of the kinematics chain that
are attached to the main body by one extremity only and which do touch
the ground in normal operation mode (unlike arms). A typical

leg is more segmented, the leg can be described with a simple array of
joints. &

\section[Compact notation]{Compact notation}

Components are usually identified with their full-length name, which is
the path to access them inside the structure tree. For convenience and
backward compatibility with pre-2.0 versions of URBI, there is also a
compact notation available. We will describe here how to construct the
compact notation starting from the full name and the structure tree.

{\itshape
Some examples:

\begin{flushleft}
\tablehead{}
\begin{supertabular}{|m{9.008cm}|m{5.533cm}|}
\hline
\sffamily Full name &
\sffamily Compact name\\\hline
\ttfamily robot.body.armR.elbow &
\ttfamily elbowR\\\hline
\ttfamily robot.body.head.yaw &
\ttfamily headYaw\\\hline
\ttfamily robot.body.legL.knee.pitch &
\ttfamily kneeL\\\hline
\ttfamily robot.body.armR.hand.finger[3][2] &
\ttfamily fingerR[3][2]\\\hline
\ttfamily robot.body.armL.hand.fingerR &
\ttfamily fingerLR\\\hline
\end{supertabular}
\end{flushleft}

The rule is to move every localization qualifier at the end of the
compact notation, in the order where they appear in the full-length
name. The remaining component names should then be considered one by
one to see if they are needed to remove ambiguities. If they are not,
like typically the robot or body components which are shared with
almost every other full-length name, they can be ignored. If finally
several component names have to be kept, they should be separated by
using upper case letters for the first character instead of a dot, like
in Java-style notation.}


Example 1: \texttt{robot.body.armL.hand.fingerR}


\begin{enumerate}
\item
Move all localization at the end: \texttt{robot.body.arm.hand.fingerLR}
\item
The fullname remaining is: \texttt{robot.body.arm.hand.finger}
\item
\texttt{finger} should be kept, \texttt{hand}, \texttt{arm},
\texttt{body} and \texttt{robot} are not necessary since every finger
component will always be attached only to a hand, itself attached to an
arm and a body and a robot.
\item
The result is \texttt{fingerLR}
\end{enumerate}

Example 2: \texttt{robot.body.head.yaw}


\begin{enumerate}
\item
No localization to move
\item
\texttt{yaw} must be kept because \texttt{head} also have a
\texttt{pitch} subcomponent and
\item
\texttt{head} must also be kept to avoid ambiguity with other components
having a \texttt{yaw} subcomponent.
\item
The result is \texttt{headYaw}
\end{enumerate}

Example 3: \texttt{robot.body.legL.knee.pitch}


\begin{enumerate}
\item
Move all localization at the end: \texttt{robot.body.leg.knee.pitchL}
\item
\texttt{pitch} is not necessary because \texttt{knee} has only a
\texttt{pitch}, so \texttt{knee} will be kept only
\item
The result is \texttt{kneeL}
\end{enumerate}
