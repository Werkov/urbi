\section{Quick Start}
\label{webots.quickstart}%

This section describes how to setup the software on your computer and
give you the basis to use URBI for Webots.


\subsection{Setup}
\label{webots.setup}%

The setup process depends on your OS, please follow the corresponding
instructions.

Since different packages are available for Linux, you should use the
package which is designed for your distribution.

Warning: root privileges are required to install this software under
Linux.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Windows}
\label{webots.setup.windows}%

\paragraph{Installation}
\label{webots.setup.windows.installation}%

To install URBI for Webots under windows, Webots must be installed on
you computer. If Webots is not installed, please first proceed to
Webots installation. Then double click on the "URBI Webots 1.0
Setup.exe" and follow the instructions given by the installer:

\begin{enumerate}

\item The installer recommend you to close all other running
  applications while installing URBI for Webots. Click "Next >{}" to
  proceed to next step.

\item Before installing URBI for Webots, you have to read and accept
  the Licence Agreement. Once you have read it, check "I accept the
  agreement" and click "Next >{}" to proceed to next step.

\item The installer will automatically detect your Webots installation
  path and install the URBI controller, the worlds and data in the
  same location. For all the other files (URBI for Webots SDK and URBI
  for Webots Documentation) you have to provide a new location. This
  is what the installer is asking at this step. Choose a custom
  location if you don't want the default one, \nolinkurl{C:\Program
    Files\Gostai\URBI Webots 1.0}, and click "Next >{}" to proceed to
  next step.

\item In this step you can choose which features will be installed on
  your computer. Required features ("URBI Webots") cannot be
  unchecked. These are the URBI controller and the Urbi for Webots
  worlds and data. They will be installed in your Webots installation
  directory. Optional features are the "URBI Software Development
  Kit", useful if you want to develop your own UObjects and plug them
  in URBI, and the "URBI Documentation". Optional features will be
  installed in the location you provided at Step 3).  Check the
  checkbox near the features you want to install, and click "Next >{}"
  to proceed to next step.

\item You can customize the location where shortcuts to URBI files
  will be installed in you Start Menu. You can choose not to put any
  shortcuts just by checking "Don't create a start menu folder". Click
  "Next >{}" to proceed to next step.

\item URBI source code files have a ".u" extension. By default the
  installer associate all ".u" files with URBI. If you don't want
  these files to be associated unckeck the corresponding
  checkbox. Then click "Next >{}" to proceed to next step.

\item The installer prints a summary of the installation options for
  you to verify that it is correct. Then click "Install" to install
  URBI for webots on your computer.

\item The installer display the README file. Click "Next >{}" to
  proceed to next step.

\item You have finished to install URBI for Webots. Click "Finish" to
  close the installer.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Linux}
\label{webots.setup.linux}%

\paragraph{RPM based distributions}
\label{webots.setup.linux.rpm}%

\begin{lstlisting}
rpm -hiv <package Urbi For Webots>.rpm
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Debian base distributions}
\label{webots.setup.linux.deb}%

Execute the following command:


\begin{lstlisting}
$ sudo dpkg --install <package Urbi For Webots>.deb
\end{lstlisting}

Your software is installed, you'll now have to setup the license.


\paragraph{Manual setup (from a tarball)}
\label{webots.setup.linux.tarball}%
     as root

\begin{lstlisting}
$ cd /
$ tar -xvzf  <package Urbi For Webots>.tgz
\end{lstlisting}
     or

\begin{lstlisting}
$ cd /
$ tar -xvjf  <package Urbi For Webots>.tar.bz2
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{MacOs}
\label{webots.setup.macos}%

\paragraph{Manual install}
\label{webots.setup.macos.manual}%

You have to be administrator on your machine in order to install
UrbiForWebots.  Extract the zip file containing URBI by double
clicking on it.  You obtain two folders: \nolinkurl{usr} and
\nolinkurl{webots}.  You have to copy the contains of the
\nolinkurl{webots} directory in the directory containing Webots
installation (if you did the default installation it is in
\nolinkurl{/Applications/Webots}), and you have to copy the contains
of the \nolinkurl{usr} folder in the \nolinkurl{/usr} system folder.


Let say you extracted the zip file in your \nolinkurl{Desktop} folder,
and that you set the variable WEBOTS\_HOME to the Webots installations
path as explained in Webots documentation.  From a shell terminal this
gives you:


\begin{lstlisting}
$ cd $HOME/Desktop
$ ls
usr webots webots-urbiengine-sdk-webots-1.03-k1462-e247-l482-powerpc-apple-darwin8-gcc-4.0.1.zip
$ cp -r usr /
$ cp -r webots/* $WEBOTS_HOME/
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Evaluation mode}
\label{webots.evaluation}%

If you don't provide a valid license file to the urbi controller, it
will be launched in evaluation mode. The only difference with the
normal version is that the controller will exit after 5 minutes, thus
letting you test all the feature we provide in the registered version
during this small period of time. When you launch Webots and URBI
without a valid license file you can see a message in Webots log that
tells you that the license is invalid or missing:


%\begin{minipage}[c]{\linewidth}
%\begin{center}
%\imgexists{images/no-license-webots-log-msg.jpg}{{\centering \imgevalsize{images/no-license-webots-log-msg.jpg}{\includegraphics[width=\imgwidth,height=\imgheight,keepaspectratio=true]{images/no-license-webots-log-msg.jpg}}}}{}\end{center}
%\end{minipage}


\subsection{License setup}
\label{webots.license}%

In order to run Urbi for Webots unlimitedly you must have a licence
file .  The Urbi for Webots licensing system is based on the Webots
licensing system.  In Webots you have two licensing system available:
\begin{itemize}
\item a license file "webots.key";
\item an USB dongle;
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Urbi licensing with "webots.key" license}
\label{webots.license.webotskey}%

To obtain an Urbi license if you use this type of licensing, please
send us a copy of your webots.key license, we will generate the Urbi
license using this file.


Once you have your "urbi.key" file, put the "webots.key" file in the
folder:
\begin{itemize}

\item \nolinkurl{webots/ressources/}

\end{itemize}
(warning: it is mandatory to have a copy of the webots.key in this
folder, if you don't have it, Urbi won't find the webots.key file and
you will get a licensing error message) and place the "urbi.key" file
in the same folder as the urbi controller. By default in
\begin{itemize}

\item \nolinkurl{webots/projects/default/controllers/urbi/}

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Urbi licensing with USB dongle}
\label{webots.license.dongleusb}%

To obtain an Urbi license if you use this type of licensing, please
send us your Webots USB dongle number (available in the help/about
webots menu). We will then generate an Urbi license using this number.


Install your "urbi.key" file in the same folder as the Urbi
controller.  By default in
\begin{itemize}

\item  \nolinkurl{webots/projects/default/controllers/urbi/}

\end{itemize}


\subsection{License problem}
\label{webots.problem}%

If you have a valid license but still get the licensing error message,
verify that you have followed correctly the setup instructions. Note
that you can specify the location of the urbi.key license to the Urbi
controller, in the .wbt files, within the "controllerArgs" field. Just
add "-{}l" and the absolute path of your license file to the field
line. Exemple (with a license file urbi.key located in
\nolinkurl{C:/mylicensefolder/})

\begin{lstlisting}
controllerArgs "-f -l C:/mylicensefolder/urbi.key  -p 54000 32 "
\end{lstlisting}
Contact us at Gostai if you still have some problems with the license,
and we will resolve the problem with you.


\subsection{Your first run}
\label{webots.firstrun}%

This section describes basic use of the URBI engine for Webots.


\subsubsection{URBI worlds}
\label{webots.firstrun.openworld}%

We provide a set of example worlds with several robots you will be
able to control through URBI. They are located in the directory:
\nolinkurl{WEBOTS_DIRECTORY/projects/packages/urbi/worlds/ }.  Open
the world named \nolinkurl{aibo_ers7_urbi_soccer.wbt}. The image
bellow is a screenshot of this world. You can see an aibo in a soccer
field, with a pink ball in front of it.


%\begin{minipage}[c]{\linewidth}
%\begin{center}
%\imgexists{images/webots-aibo-soccer.jpg}{{\centering \imgevalsize{images/webots-aibo-soccer.jpg}{\includegraphics[width=600pt,keepaspectratio=true]{images/webots-aibo-soccer.jpg}}}}{}\end{center}
%\end{minipage}


If you look in Webots scene tree, you will see that the aibo (real
name is ERS7) is a CustomRobot node, and that it uses urbi as
controller.


%\begin{minipage}[c]{\linewidth}
%\begin{center}
%\imgexists{images/webots-scene-tree.jpg}{{\centering \imgevalsize{images/webots-scene-tree.jpg}{\includegraphics[width=\imgwidth,height=\imgheight,keepaspectratio=true]{images/webots-scene-tree.jpg}}}}{}\end{center}
%\end{minipage}


Let's see how this controller let you control the robot.


\subsubsection{URBI controller}
\label{webots.firstrun.urbicontroller}%

You have two ways to control your robot through the URBI
controller. The first way is by remotely sending commands to the URBI
controller. The URBI controller act as a server, and let you connect
to it through the network, and then send URBI commands to this server.
The second way is by writing URBI scripts that will be loaded at
controller start up.


\subsubsection{Send commands with a client software}
\label{webots.firstrun.clientsoftware}%

In order to connect to the URBI controller and then send commands, you
need to use a client software that allows you to connect on some
address on the network and let you send data through this connection.
The simplest program which do this is the \textbf{telnet} program,
available on all platform (Windows, Linux and MacOs). You can also use
one of the program available at Urbiforge (http://www.urbiforge.com)
in the Tool section.  The URBI controller launched with the
aibo\_er7\_urbi\_soccer world is waiting for connections coming on
your computer, on port 54000. So to connect on it you will have to
specify the address of your computer ('localhost') and the right port
(54000).


\paragraph{Telnet}
\label{webots.firstrun.clientsoftware.telnet}%

\subparagraph{Windows}
\label{webots.firstrun.clientsoftware.telnet.windows}%

To launch \textbf{telnet} under windows click on the start menu, and
then on run.


%\begin{minipage}[c]{\linewidth}
%\begin{center}
%\imgexists{images/click-run-windows.gif}{{\centering \imgevalsize{images/click-run-windows.gif}{\includegraphics[width=\imgwidth,height=\imgheight,keepaspectratio=true]{images/click-run-windows.gif}}}}{}\end{center}
%\end{minipage}


Type \textbf{cmd} and click OK. This will launch a dos command prompt.


%\begin{minipage}[c]{\linewidth}
%\begin{center}
%\imgexists{images/run-cmd-windows.png}{{\centering \imgevalsize{images/run-cmd-windows.png}{\includegraphics[width=\imgwidth,height=\imgheight,keepaspectratio=true]{images/run-cmd-windows.png}}}}{}\end{center}
%\end{minipage}


In the dos command prompt type \textbf{telnet localhost 54000}.


%\begin{minipage}[c]{\linewidth}
%\begin{center}
%\imgexists{images/telnet-windows.PNG}{{\centering \imgevalsize{images/telnet-windows.PNG}{\includegraphics[width=\imgwidth,height=\imgheight,keepaspectratio=true]{images/telnet-windows.PNG}}}}{}\end{center}
%\end{minipage}


This launch telnet. It connect to the URBI controller, and the URBI
controller send you the URBI header (the lines that display on the
screen). On windows the text is badly displayed because of some
character conversion problem. It is still usable even if it is not
really convenient.


%\begin{minipage}[c]{\linewidth}
%\begin{center}
%\imgexists{images/telnet-urbi-windows.PNG}{{\centering \imgevalsize{images/telnet-urbi-windows.PNG}{\includegraphics[width=\imgwidth,height=\imgheight,keepaspectratio=true]{images/telnet-urbi-windows.PNG}}}}{}\end{center}
%\end{minipage}


\subparagraph{Linux and MacOs}
\label{webots.firstrun.clientsoftware.telnet.linuxandmacos}%

Open a new shell and type \textbf{telnet localhost 54000}.  This
launch telnet. It connect to the URBI controller, and the URBI
controller send you the Urbi header.


%\begin{minipage}[c]{\linewidth}
%\begin{center}
%\imgexists{images/telnet-urbi-linux.jpg}{{\centering \imgevalsize{images/telnet-urbi-linux.jpg}{\includegraphics[width=\imgwidth,height=\imgheight,keepaspectratio=true]{images/telnet-urbi-linux.jpg}}}}{}\end{center}
%\end{minipage}


\subparagraph{Use telnet to send commands}
\label{webots.firstrun.clientsoftware.telnet.usetelnet}%

Now that you are connected to the URBI controller, you can send
command to it and makes your robot move and interact with it's
environment. For example try typing the following commands in
\textbf{telnet}:

\begin{lstlisting}
headPan = 50 time: 5s;
headPan = -50 time: 5s;
headPan = 0 time: 5s;
\end{lstlisting}
And you will see the head of the aibo move left, right, and then to
the center.


%\begin{minipage}[c]{\linewidth}
%\begin{center}
%\imgexists{images/telnet-some-urbi-cmd.jpg}{{\centering \imgevalsize{images/telnet-some-urbi-cmd.jpg}{\includegraphics[width=\imgwidth,height=\imgheight,keepaspectratio=true]{images/telnet-some-urbi-cmd.jpg}}}}{}\end{center}
%\end{minipage}


\subsubsection{Load URBI programs at controller start}
\label{webots.firstrun.loadprograms}%

\paragraph{By adding the file as argument of the URBI controller}
\label{webots.firstrun.loadprograms.cmd_line}%

It is possible to write some URBI script and load it at controller
startup.  To do this just write URBI code in some file, and then
specify it's path in the controllerArgs webots node.  For example
create a new text file, rename it test.u and write in it:


\begin{lstlisting}
robot.sit (),
\end{lstlisting}

Then edit the webots world aibo\_ers7\_urbi\_soccer.wbt, and add the
path of your file test.u on the line of the controllerArgs node.


\begin{lstlisting}
controllerArgs "-f -p 54000 32 [HERE ADD YOUR SCRIPT FILES]"
\end{lstlisting}

For exemple let say that you created your file in
\begin{itemize}

\item C:/Program Files/webots/projects/packages/urbi/data/aibo/ (under
  Windows)



\item /Applications/webots/projects/packages/urbi/data/aibo/ (under
  Macos)



\item /usr/local/webots/projects/packages/urbi/data/aibo/ (under
  Linux)


\end{itemize}
        Then you can specify the path to your file in a absolute form:
 \begin{itemize}

\item   C:/Program Files/webots/projects/packages/urbi/data/aibo/test.u (under Windows)



\item   /Applications/webots/projects/packages/urbi/data/aibo/test.u (under Macos)



\item   /usr/local/webots/projects/packages/urbi/data/aibo/test.u (under Linux)


\end{itemize}
       Or you can specify it's path relativelly to the Urbi controller location.
      Let say that you are using the Urbi controller located here:
 \begin{itemize}

\item   C:/Program Files/webots/projects/default/controllers/urbi/urbi (under Windows)



\item   /Applications/webots/projects/default/controllers/urbi/urbi (under Macos)



\item   /usr/local/webots/projects/default/controllers/urbi/urbi (under Linux).


\end{itemize}
       Then the path to your file relatively to the Urbi controller is:
 \begin{itemize}

\item   ../../../packages/urbi/data/aibo/test.u (under Windows|Linux|Macos)


\end{itemize}
         Add this path to the controllerArgs line and it gives:


\begin{lstlisting}
# Under Windows, absolute path version:
controllerArgs "-f -p 54000 50 \"C:/Program Files/webots/projects/packages/urbi/data/aibo/test.u\""
(note the use of \" \" about the path, which are mandatory if the path
contains spaces. Here between Program and Files)

# Under MacOs, absolute path version:
controllerArgs "-f -p 54000 50 /Applications/webots/projects/packages/urbi/data/aibo/test.u"

# Under Linux, absolute path version:
controllerArgs "-f -p 54000 50 /usr/local/webots/projects/packages/urbi/data/aibo/test.u"

# Relative path version (os independant)
controllerArgs "-f -p 54000 50 ../../../packages/urbi/data/aibo/test.u"
\end{lstlisting}

NB: If you have some spaces in your file path, you have to add
backslashed double quotes in order to have webots and Urbi understand
the path correctly.


Now when you launch Webots and you open the world
aibo\_ers7\_urbi\_soccer.wbt you can verify that the controllerArgs
was correctly updated.


%\begin{minipage}[c]{\linewidth}
%\begin{center}
%\imgexists{images/webots-scene-tree-add-loaded-file.jpg}{{\centering \imgevalsize{images/webots-scene-tree-add-loaded-file.jpg}{\includegraphics[width=\imgwidth,height=\imgheight,keepaspectratio=true]{images/webots-scene-tree-add-loaded-file.jpg}}}}{}\end{center}
%\end{minipage}


And if you look at the world view, you can see that the controller has
executed the URBI code you specified: the aibo has sat.


%\begin{minipage}[c]{\linewidth}
%\begin{center}
%\imgexists{images/webots-aibo-sat.jpg}{{\centering \imgevalsize{images/webots-aibo-sat.jpg}{\includegraphics[width=400pt,keepaspectratio=true]{images/webots-aibo-sat.jpg}}}}{}\end{center}
%\end{minipage}


\paragraph{By loading the file in URBI.ini}
\label{webots.firstrun.loadprograms.inURBIinifile}%

By default, we don't specify files on the Webots controllerArg
line. We specify directories.  At startup, the URBI controller will go
through these directories and try to find a file named
\nolinkurl{URBI.ini}. This is a special file containing URBI code
which is always loaded at start up by the URBI controller. So another
way to load your custom URBI code at start up is to use the command
'load'.  Take the \nolinkurl{test.u} file we created in the previous
section and move it to the folder containing the \nolinkurl{URBI.ini}
file. Then open \nolinkurl{URBI.ini} and add at the end of the file:


\begin{lstlisting}
      load ("test.u");
\end{lstlisting}
Now launch Webots and open the world using the URBI controller loading
the URBI.ini you just updated, and you will see that your code has
been loaded too.

\section{Built-{}in robots and worlds}
\label{webots.builtin}%

This section deals with the robots and worlds provided with the the
engine.


\subsection{Understanding the URBI for Webots hierarchy}
\label{webots.builtin.hierarchy}%

 Urbi for Webots is bundled with a lot of files. Here is a description of
those files.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}\hline
  Directory &   Description \\
  webots/projects/default/controllers & Contains the URBI controller. \\

  webots/projects/packages/urbi/data/pioneer2 & Pioneer2 robots directory \\
  webots/projects/packages/urbi/data/ustd &     Ustd directory (please see Ustd dedicated documentation for more information) \\
  webots/projects/packages/urbi/worlds &        URBI for Webots worlds directory \\
  webots/projects/packages/urbi/worlds/aibo\_ers210\_urbi.wbt & Main world for the Aibo ERS-210. \\
  webots/projects/packages/urbi/worlds/aibo\_ers7\_urbi.wbt &   Main world for the Aibo ERS-7. \\
  webots/projects/packages/urbi/worlds/aibo\_ers7\_urbi\_soccer.wbt &   Soccer world for the Aibo ERS-7. \\
  webots/projects/packages/urbi/worlds/aibo\_ers7\_urbi\_supervisor.wbt &       Supervisor world for the Aibo ERS-7 (see the supervisor section). \\
  webots/projects/packages/urbi/worlds/e-puck\_urbi.wbt &       Main world for the e-puck. \\
  webots/projects/packages/urbi/worlds/kiki\_urbi.wbt & Main world for the kiki example robot. \\
  webots/projects/packages/urbi/worlds/pioneer2\_urbi.wbt &     Main world for the Pioneer 2. \\
  webots/projects/packages/urbi/worlds/textures &       World's textures directory. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\caption{Directory hierarchy}
\label{webots.builtin.directory}%
\end{table}

 It is important to notice the data's directory hierarchy, each path follows
the following rule:


\begin{lstlisting}
data/<ROBOT NAME>
\end{lstlisting}

If several version of the robots are available, the following
rule is applied:

\begin{lstlisting}
data/<ROBOT NAME>/<VERSION>
\end{lstlisting}

 In those directories, standard files are:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}\hline
  File &        Description \\
  CLIENT.INI &  Client initialization script (required). \\
  config.u &    Configuration file (used to customize the robot). \\
  <ROBOT>.ini & Robot hardware layout. \\
  URBI.INI &    Server initialization script (required). \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\caption{Standard robot's files}
\label{webots.builtin.files}%
\end{table}

\subsection{Worlds special features}
\label{webots.builtin.worlds}%

 This section describes the special features of some worlds.
The worlds referenced in the previous section as the "main"
world have no specificities.


\subsubsection{The soccer world (balltracking)}
\label{webots.builtin.worlds.soccer}%

 Launch Webots and load the soccer world
(\nolinkurl{aibo_ers7_urbi_soccer.wbt}).


Connect to the URBI server and use the following command:

\begin{lstlisting}
unfreeze balltracking;
\end{lstlisting}

 This will activate the balltracking of the ERS-{}7 robot.
Now, you can use \textbf{shift} and the mouse to move
the ball, the ERS-{}7 will move its head to follow the ball.


\subsubsection{The supervisor world}
\label{webots.builtin.worlds.supervisor}%

 Launch Webots and load the supervisor world
(\nolinkurl{aibo_ers7_urbi_supervisor.wbt}).


 It is crucial to understand that this world launches two URBI servers.
The robot's server on the port 54001 and the supervisor server on the
port 54002.


 A supervisor is a kind of robot in Webots which can be used ton control
the world. It is used, for example, in the Webots soccer example to give
the ball's position.


 If you create a supervisor node which is linked to an URBI controller,
this will allow you to control the world through URBI.


 Warning: don't forget to give different ports for each robot you add in a
Webots world. If this is not the case, some controllers will not work.


 After having started the simulation of the supervisor world, execute
the following lines:


\begin{lstlisting}
// Create a moving label.
l = new Label("URBI for Webots");
l.size = 0.04;
l.r = 125 sin:10s ampli:125,
l.x = 0.2 sin:10s ampli:0.1,

// Manipulate the floor.
fl = new ManipulateNode("FLOOR");
fl.ty = -1 sin:10s ampli:0.5,
\end{lstlisting}

 The first part of the script creates a label and defines a movement
with the sin modifier. The second part moves the floor.


For a complete documentation of those nodes, please read the
next sections.

\subsection{Robots specific functions}
\label{webots.builtin.robots}%

 A lot of functions are directly available in URBI to generate
high-{}level behaviour. Those features will be described in the
next section.


\subsubsection{Aibo specific functions}
\label{webots.builtin.robots.aibo}%

 The following table sums up the aibo's functions.

\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline|robot.walk(duration)|\\
  Walk for duration milliseconds (walk backward if duration is negative).
\item \lstinline|robot.stopwalk()|\\
  Interrupt the walk.
\item \lstinline|robot.turn(duration)|\\
  Turn counter-clockwise for duration milliseconds (turn backward if duration is negative).
\item \lstinline|robot.stopturn()|\\
  Interrupt the turn.
\item \lstinline|robot.initial()|\\
  Initial position sitting down (stretch and lay).
\item \lstinline|robot.stretch()|\\
  Stretching like in the morning...
\item \lstinline|robot.lay()|\\
  Laying (sitting down).
\item \lstinline|robot.sit()|\\
  Sit on the back.
\item \lstinline|robot.beg()|\\
  Stand up with knees bent.
\item \lstinline|robot.stand()|\\
  Stand up.
\end{itemize}

\section{Making your own URBI for Webots controllers}
\label{webots.own}%

\subsection{Create from an existing world}
\label{webots.own.create}%

     As soon as you will want to go further, you will have to create your own
    URBI for Webots based controllers. Here is how to proceed:

\begin{enumerate}

\item      Create a new directory in your \nolinkurl{data} directory
     (say \nolinkurl{foo}). This directory should be named as your
     new robot.



\item      Copy into your \nolinkurl{foo} directory the content
     of the kiki directory.



\item     Edit the \nolinkurl{kiki.ini} file and rename it into your
    robot's name (i.e. \nolinkurl{foo.ini} in this example).



\item     Edit the \nolinkurl{URBI.INI} file and change the line:


\begin{lstlisting}
    load("kiki.ini");
\end{lstlisting}

by:

\begin{lstlisting}
    load("foo.ini"); // The name should match with the file you've just renamed.
\end{lstlisting}




\item Copy the kiki world file (\nolinkurl{worlds/kiki_urbi.wbt}
  should be copied into \nolinkurl{worlds/foo_urbi.wbt} for example).


  Edit your new world file and check that the field ControllerArgs
  contains the directory you've just created. It should be, for
  example: \texttt{-{}\-p 5\-4\-0\-0\-0 5\-0
    .\-.\-/\-.\-.\-/\-.\-.\-/\-p\-a\-c\-k\-a\-g\-e\-s\-/\-u\-r\-b\-i\-/\-d\-a\-t\-a\-/\-f\-o\-o}.
  The Controller field should keep its value to \texttt{u\-r\-b\-i}.


\end{enumerate}

Your robot is now ready to be controlled by URBI. During the next
part, you'll learn how to customize the robot you have created.


\subsection{Customize}
\label{webots.own.customize}%

To handle each robots' specificities, Webots use a set of devices
which is fully supported by URBI for Webots. Those devices are created
in a special file which is called like your robot in its data
directory. With the previous example, it would have been the
\nolinkurl{data/foo/foo.ini} file. This file should be like the
following piece of code:


\begin{lstlisting}
system.name = "/gostai/webots/kiki";
system.type = "webots";


wheelL = new DifferentialWheels("kiki", true);
alias wheelL.val wheelL.speed;
wheelR = new DifferentialWheels("kiki", false);
group wheels {wheelL, wheelR};

alias wheelR.val wheelR.speed;
eyeL = new DistanceSensor("ir0");
eyeR = new DistanceSensor("ir1");

// Standard groups
group software {};
group hardware {wheelL, wheelR, eyeL, eyeR};
group objects {software, hardware};

// Standard aliases
// etc.
\end{lstlisting}

The first line is your robot's name, you may edit this to any value.
The second line must keep its value.


After this, you need to create your robot's devices. It's very easy:
you just have to follow the rule: \texttt{
  d\-e\-v\-i\-c\-e\-n\-a\-m\-e = n\-e\-w
  d\-e\-v\-i\-c\-e\-t\-y\-p\-e\-(\-"\-n\-a\-m\-e o\-f t\-h\-e
  d\-e\-v\-i\-c\-e\-'\-s n\-o\-d\-e i\-n t\-h\-e w\-o\-r\-l\-d
  f\-i\-l\-e\-"\-)\-;\- }

The node name can be retrieved easily from the Webots world tree
editor.

One exception is the
\texttt{D\-i\-f\-f\-e\-r\-e\-n\-t\-i\-a\-l\-W\-h\-e\-e\-l} device.
There is always two lines. The first has its second argument set to
\texttt{t\-r\-u\-e} and will create the left wheel. The second with
its second argument set to \texttt{f\-a\-l\-s\-e} create the right
wheel.


The last step is editing the groups to add your new devices. The
hardware group should contain all the devices your robot uses. You may
also create subgroup to ease robot's programming.


\subsection{Urbi controller options}
\label{webots.own.controlleroptions}%

 The Urbi controller can take several options which modify it's behaviour.
You specify the controller options in the controllerArgs field of the Webots
world (.wbt) files.
 The controllerArgs must be as follow:

\begin{lstlisting}
controllerArgs [options] period [path1 path2 ...]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{itemize}

\item period: base URBI interval in milliseconds. You have to set the
  same period for the Urbi controller and for the Webots worlds. The
  period in the webots world is defined in the field "basicTimeStep".


\item [path ..] items are absolute or relative path elements searched
  in order to find Urbi files when 'load' is called.


\item options:
  \begin{itemize}

  \item -{}f : enable fast mode: the server will run as fast as
    possible and emulate the period specified.  Don't set -{}f option
    when there is "runRealTime TRUE" in the Webots world.  Always set
    -{}f otherwise.


  \item -{}l license\_key : specify the license key to use


  \item -{}p port : specify the tcp port URBI will listen to.

  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

  Type: float.


  Definition: Encoders are counters incremented each time a wheel
  turns. The amount added to the encoder is computed from the angle
  the wheel have been rotated and from the "encoderResolution"
  parameter of the DifferentialWheels node. For convenience we also
  provide an "encoderFactor" which allows you to change easily the
  unit of the encoder on the Urbi side.  Hence, if the
  "encoderResolution" is 100, the "encoderFactor" is -{}1 and the
  wheel made a whole revolution, the corresponding encoder will have
  its value incremented by about 100 * -{}1 * 6.28 = -{}628.  Setting
  encoders value will not make the wheels rotate to reach the
  specified value, instead, it will simply reset the encoders with the
  specified value.  Retrieved and set with the following Webots
  functions:


\begin{lstlisting}
  int differential_wheels_get_left_encoder (void); int
  differential_wheels_get_right_encoder (void); void
  differential_wheels_set_encoders (int left, int right);
\end{lstlisting}

  Type: float.


  Definition: Current speed of the wheels. The speed unit is defined
  by the "speedUnit" field of the Webots DifferentialWheels node. The
  default value is 0.1 radian per seconds. For convenience we also
  provide an "speedFactor" which allows you to change easily the unit
  of the speed on the Urbi side.  With a "speedFactor" of 10, a speed
  value of 20 will make the wheel rotate at a speed of 10 * 20 * 0.1 =
  20 radian per seconds.  Set with the following Webots function:


\begin{lstlisting}
  void differential_wheels_set_speed(short left, short right);
\end{lstlisting}
\item[{speedFactor}] Permissions: readable, writeable.

file).

\item[{         val
 }]            Permissions: readable, writeable.


 Type: float.


 Description: Distance returned by the sensor. If you want to change
 the unit of the distance sensor you can use the "factor" attribute,
 because the "val" attribute is multiplied by the "factor" attribute
 before being returned: "val" = "val" * "factor".

          of the name field, in the Emitter node in Webots.

\end{description}

\paragraph{Functions}
\label{webots.uobjects.robotdevices.emitter.functions}%

\noindent
\begin{description}
\item[{send (UrbiVariable)}] Adds to the emitters's queue a packet
  corresponding to the data of the UrbiVariable, plus some
  informations on the type of the variable. Then the enqueued data
  packets will be sent to potential receivers (and removed from the
  emitter's queue) at the rate specified by the baudRate field of the
  Emitter node. On success this function returns 0. If the queue is
  currently full, 1 is returned and the packet will not be
  enqueued. The queue is considered to be full when the sum of bytes
  of all the enqueued packets exceeds the buffer size specified by the
  bufferSize field.  NB: You can send every type of URBI variables
  with the send function EXCEPT UObjects variables.


          Example:


\begin{lstlisting}
var1 = "hello world";
emitter.send (var1);
// will send 13 bytes:
// '"','h','e','l','l','o',' ','w','o','r','l','d','"'
// note that the enclosing quotes ("") are also send, in order for the
// receiver to be able to recognize that the received data is a string
var2=BIN 11;hello world
emitter.send (var2),
// will send 20 bytes: 5 bytes for the BIN header, 2 bytes for the
// size, 1 byte for the ';', and 11 bytes for the actual data (hello
// world) (the BIN header size can augment if you set some information
// in the BIN header variable, like in images variables for example).
\end{lstlisting}

Note that if you set the "rawMode" attribute to true, then the
comportment of the send () function will change. When "rawMode" is
true, you can only send BIN variables with the send () function, and
only the data in the BIN variable is send.


\begin{lstlisting}
var2=BIN 11;hello world
emitter.rawMode = true;
emitter.send (var2);
/// Will send 11 bytes:
// 'h','e','l','l','o',' ','w','o','r','l','d'
// ie only the bytes that are in the data of the BIN variable.
\end{lstlisting}

Please note that since no type information is included in the send
data, an URBI receiver won't be able to parse the data received and
won't be able to recreate the corresponding URBI variable.


This function use the following Webots functions:


\begin{lstlisting}
int emitter_send_packet  (DeviceTag emitter, const void *data, int size);
\end{lstlisting}

\item[{receive ()}] Returns an URBI variable corresponding to the data
  of the packet at the head of the reception queue. An URBI receiver
  can only receive data from an URBI emitter, because the URBI emitter
  send the data corresponding to URBI variables given to its emit ()
  function, plus some informations on the type of the variable. The
  receiver then parse the received data to recreate the URBI variable.
  If the URBI emitter is in rawMode, the Receiver won't be able to
  parse the received values.  So you have to set the receiver rawMode
  also. In raw mode, the receiver returns BIN variables containing the
  data received.  Please refers to Webots documentation for more
  information on the Receiver device.

          that for any Solid node containing a Physics node, the linear
          and angular velocities of the corresponding body is reset to 0,
          hence the inertia is stopped. This function is especially useful
          when resetting a robot at an initial position from which no
          initial inertia is required.
          This function resets the seed of the random number generator

\noindent
\begin{description}
\item[{int set (UBinary b)}]      Set the UBinary you want to parse. You have to call the 'set'
          function before calling the 'read' function.
          Return 0 in case of success, and 1 in case of error.

\item[{UList read (String format)}]       Read formated binary data from the UBinary, and return a list
  corresponding to the data which was read.


  'format' is a list of type identifiants separated by ','.


  The type identifiants describe a type, and are of the form Type[:n]
  where Type can be:
  \begin{itemize}

\item{}i8  : 8 bits integer

\item{}i16 : 16 bits int

\item{}i32 : 32 bits integer

\item{}i64 : 64 bits integer

\item{}u8  : 8 bits unsigned integer

\item{}u16 : 16 bits unsigned integer

\item{}u32 : 32 bits unsigned integer

\item{}u64 : 64 bits unsigned integer

\item{}f32 : 32 bits float

\item{}f64 : 64 bits float

\item{}c   : 8 bits character
\end{itemize}
and where 'n' specify the number of time the UBinaryReader should read
a value of this type.


'n' is optional (that is the meaning of the enclosing '[' ']' which
are not part of the syntax).


The function return a list of values corresponding to the data read.
In case of character data, if you specify the 'n' parameter, then the
characters are concateneted and put in a string.


ex:


\begin{lstlisting}
p = new UBinaryReader();
a = BIN 10;abcdefghij   /// Create an UBinary which contains abcdefghij
p.set (a);              /// Set the UBinary in the reader.
p.read ("c,i8");        /// we read: a character then an 8 bits integer
[00175588] ["a", 98]    /// a is for the 'a' and 98 for the 'b' (8 bit ascii
                        /// code is 98)
p.index = 0;            /// Set the reading cursor to the begining.
p.read ("c,c:3,i8:2,i16"),
[00161064] ["a", "bcd", 101, 102, 26727]
p.index = 4;            /// Set the reading cursor to read the 5th character
p.read ("c:5"),
[00169480] ["efghi"]
\end{lstlisting}

          In case of error, the function stop reading, and return a
          list containing the values that were successfully read until
          the error occur. The function then set the reading cursor
          'index' to -{}1, and set an error message in the 'error'
          attribute.

\end{description}

\paragraph{Attributes}
\label{webots.uobjects.other.ubinaryreader.attributes}%

\noindent
\begin{description}
\item{}[{index}] Index of the reading cursor. When you read from an
  UBinary with the 'read' function, this index is automatically
  updated so that the next read will occur where the previous read
  stopped.


  You can change the position of the reading cursor by assigning a new
  value to 'index'. Note that the begining of the UBinary is
  associated to a value of 0 for 'index'.


  'index' cannot be greater than the UBinary size.


  When a reading error occur, 'index' is set to -{}1, and you have to
  change it's value manually to continue reading.

\item{}[{size}]           The size of the UBinary currently read.

\item{}[{error}]          In case of error, this attribute contains a readable error message
          corresponding to the error.

\section{Develop your own UObjects}
\label{webots.ownuobjects}%

This section describes how to create new UObjects and integrate them
in your URBI controller to use them from .


\subsection{Code your UObjects}
\label{webots.ownuobjects.code}%

   To create your own UObjects, please refer to the online documentation
  on Gostai website: \url{http://www.gostai.com/doc/en/uobject/}.


\subsection{Compile}
\label{webots.ownuobjects.compile}%

\subsubsection{Windows}
\label{webots.ownuobjects.compile.windows}%

     For now we only support compilation with Mingw under windows. We
    recommend that you use DevCpp (which use Mingw compiler) to compile
    your projects.
    We provide a sample DevCpp project in \nolinkurl{URBI_DIRECTORY/doc/sample}.
    The directory contain two files:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{}         sample.dev: the DevCpp project file



\item{}         helloworld.cpp: a sample UObject which prints "Hello World !" at
        initialisation. You may replace this file with your own UObject
        files.


\end{itemize}


If you do not want to use this sample project, you have to do the
following: compile your UObject files and link with the libraries we
provide. This to generate an executable that you will name urbi.exe.
Here is the list of option that you have to provide to your compiler:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{}         Include path: \nolinkurl{URBI_DIRECTORY/SDK/include}. By default it is
 \nolinkurl{c:\Program Files\GOSTAI\URBI Webots 1.0\SDK\include}


\item{}         Library path:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{}  \nolinkurl{URBI_DIRECTORY/SDK/lib}. By default it is
 \nolinkurl{c:\Program Files\GOSTAI\URBI Webots 1.0\SDK\lib}.



\item{}  \nolinkurl{WEBOTS_DIRECTORY/lib}. By default it is
 \nolinkurl{c:\Program Files\Webots\lib}.


\end{itemize}



\item{}         Library to link with:
 \begin{itemize}

 \item{} liburbicore.a: you have to specify that you want all the
   symbol of the library to be included, so you have to add the option
   -{}whole-{}archive to the link line. You may write it as follow:
   "-{}Wl,-{}whole-{}archive -{}lurbicore
   -{}Wl,-{}no-{}whole-{}archive"



\item{}               libjpeg.a: you MUST link with the static libjpeg that we provide in
 \nolinkurl{URBI_DIRECTORY/SDK/lib}


\item{}               libeay32.dll



\item{}               libController.dll



\item{}               ws2\_32.dll



\item{}               libgdi32.dll



\item{}               Iphlpapi.dll



\item{}             libboost\_thread-{}mt.a


\end{itemize}


\end{itemize}
We distribute separately some version of boost 1.34.1 library. You can
download them for Mingw here: \url{http://www.gostai.com/boost/}.
Again we strongly advise you to use the sample DevCpp that we provide.


\subsubsection{Linux and MacOs}
\label{webots.ownuobjects.compile.linux}%

To compile under Linux use umake. Please refer to the documentation on
Gostai website: \url{http://www.gostai.com/doc/en/umake/}.  With a
default install of Webots and URBI for Webots, you just have to be in
the directory containing your source UObject files and type the
command:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ umake-engine -C webots -o urbi
\end{lstlisting}


Important: since release 1.5 you also need to link with boost 1.34.1
library.  In particular you need to link with libboost\_thread. Under
Linux we provide binaries for boost library 1.34.1 on this page:
\url{http://www.gostai.com/boost/}. The binary available under Linux
are compiled with gcc4.1 and gcc3.3. If you use a different compiler
you have to compile yourself the libraries. Please go to:
\url{http://www.boost.org/} to download a source tarball and install
it.  We don't provide any tarballs for Mac. You can get the binaries
using the install system MacPorts: \url{http://www.macports.org} or by
compiling boost 1.34.1 from the sources.


\subsection{Use the generated executable}
\label{webots.ownuobjects.use}%

To use the executable you have generated (either urbi.exe on Windows
or Urbi on Linux) simply replace the Urbi controller in
\nolinkurl{webots/projects/default/controllers/urbi/} by your
executable. That's it ! Launch Webots, connect to the URBI server,
allocate a new object of type your UObject and use it.

\section{Copyright}
\label{webots.copyright}%

\begin{lstlisting}

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE
TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR
"LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE
LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE
OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS
YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF
SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   1. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
   anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
   unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
   constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
   assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
   Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
   defined below) for the purposes of this License.  2. "Derivative
   Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
   pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
   dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound
   recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other
   form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
   except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
   considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For
   the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or
   sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation
   with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative
   Work for the purpose of this License.  3. "Licensor" means the
   individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this
   License.  4. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who
   created the Work.  5. "Work" means the copyrightable work of
   authorship offered under the terms of this License.  6. "You" means
   an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who
   has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect
   to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
   Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
   violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or
other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

   1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
   Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
   Collective Works; 2. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
   display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means
   of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated
   in Collective Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make
Derivative Works. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in
Sections 4(d) and 4(e).

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
   publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
   License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
   Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
   Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
   publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
   on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the
   recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not
   sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
   this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not
   distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
   digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
   control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the
   terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as
   incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
   Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to
   the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon
   notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
   remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
   the Original Author, as requested.  2. You may not exercise any of
   the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is
   primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
   private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other
   copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise
   shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward
   commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
   there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
   the exchange of copyrighted works.  3. If you distribute, publicly
   display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work,
   You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give
   the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You
   are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of
   the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied;
   and to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
   Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with
   the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
   licensing information for the Work. Such credit may be implemented
   in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
   Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any
   other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least
   as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.  4.

      For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
         composition: 1. Performance Royalties Under Blanket
         Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect,
         whether individually or via a performance rights society
         (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
         performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of
         the Work if that performance is primarily intended for or
         directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
         compensation.  2. Mechanical Rights and Statutory
         Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect,
         whether individually or via a music rights agency or
         designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any
         phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and
         distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17
         USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in
         other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover
         version is primarily intended for or directed toward
         commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
         5. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the
         avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording,
         Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether
         individually or via a performance-rights society
         (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital
         performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the
         compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
         Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if
         Your public digital performance is primarily intended for or
         directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
         compensation.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR
OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR
THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF
ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY
NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
   automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
   License. Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works
   from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
   terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
   compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
   survive any termination of this License.  2. Subject to the above
   terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for
   the duration of the applicable copyright in the
   Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
   release the Work under different license terms or to stop
   distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
   election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
   license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
   terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
   force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work
   or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
   license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
   granted to You under this License.  2. If any provision of this
   License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall
   not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
   terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to
   this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
   extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
   3. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
   no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
   writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
   consent.  4. This License constitutes the entire agreement between
   the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
   understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
   Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
   additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
   You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
   agreement of the Licensor and You.
