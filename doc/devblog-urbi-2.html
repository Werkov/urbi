With Urbi 1 Gostai introduced a revolutionary means to program robots:
a domain specific scripting language that brings together the
efficient of C++, and the flexibility of a dynamic language.  Urbi 1
was designed pragmatically, based on user requests and feedback.
That's how Urbi 1 was made useful, and how it met its users'
expectations.  Yet, because of this iterative design process, it
suffers a number of limitations.  <br />

To address these issues, Gostai launched the Urbi 2 project months
ago. We are happy to announce that Urbi 2 is up and running.  It will
be made available for technical preview in the near future.  In the
meanwhile, let us show you some of the changes we made in Urbi.  For a
start, we will focus on the changes of the Object-Orientation support
in Urbi, later articles will cover other facets of the Urbi 2 system.
<br />

What follows is implemented, runs, and can be done at home in total safety.

<h2>Full Object Orientation Support</h2>

<ul>
<li>Everything is an object.<br />
  In the 1.x series there were several kind of entities: numbers,
  lists, strings, images, etc. and objects.  In the 2.x series,
  everything is an object, including the atomic values.  For instance
  <tt>"foo"</tt> evaluates into an object that derives from the
  <tt>String</tt>.
</li>

<li>Objects are dictionaries of slots.<br />
  Objects are implemented as associative arrays: a mapping from
  symbols to objects.
</li>

<li>The distinction between value and function is blurred.<br />
From a software engineering point of view, the client (i.e., the
"caller") should not know how the provider (i.e., the "callee") is
implemented.  In particular, it is an implementation detail whether
<tt>object.feature</tt> is an attribute, or a function taking no
argument.  Therefore, parentheses are not needed to invoke
functions that do not have argument (other that <tt>self</tt>).
<code>
   # 0-ary functions and attributes should behave equally.
   var feature = 42;
   [11648000] 42
   feature;
   [11680000] 42
   feature();
   [11712000] 42
   feature(42);
   [11776000:error] !!! input.u:8.1-11: expected 0 arguments, given 1
   
   feature = function () { 42 };
   [11872000] function () {
     42
   }
   feature;
   [12000000] 42
   feature();
   [12128000] 42
   feature(42);
   [12192000:error] !!! input.u:10.1-11: expected 0 arguments, given 1
   
   feature = function (x) { x };
   [12256000] function (x) {
     x
   }
   feature;
   [12288000:error] !!! input.u:26.1-7: expected 1 arguments, given 0
   feature();
   [12288000:error] !!! input.u:28.1-9: expected 1 arguments, given 0
   feature(42);
   [12384000] 42
</code>
</li>

<li>Functions are first-class citizens.<br />
In other words, functions are objects and can be manipulated like
any other type of object.  For instance you may copy a function
from an object to another.  Be careful though that by default code
is evaluated, see the following example.
<code>
   var counter_ = 0;
   [09856000] 0
   var counter = function () { counter_ += 1; };
   [09952000] function () {
     counter_ . '+='(1);
   }
   counter;
   [10080000] 1
   counter;
   [10208000] 2
   var counter2 = counter;
   [10368000] 3
   counter2;
   [10400000] 3
   counter2;
   [10432000] 3
   var counter3 = getSlot("counter");
   [10528000] function () {
     counter_ . '+='(1);
   }
   counter3;
   [10656000] 4
   counter3;
   [10784000] 5
   counter;
   [10912000] 6
</code>
</li>

<li>Arbitrary identifiers.<br />
Identifiers can be composed of any sequence of characters enclosed
between <tt>'</tt>, but some sequences behave magically.

<ul>
  <li>Regular identifiers.<br />
    Traditional identifiers (<tt>MyObject</tt>, <tt>my_function_2</tt>,
    <tt>SomeVariableName</tt> etc.) need no quotes.
  </li>
  
  <li>Traditional connectives.<br />
    Connectives such as <tt>+</tt>, <tt>*</tt>, <tt>&lt;=</tt> and so forth, when
    used unquoted behave as usual (e.g., <tt>1 &lt; 2</tt>), but between
    quotes, they behave like regular function names (e.g.,
    <tt>1.'&lt;'(2)</tt>).
  </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Fewer primitives, more expressive power.<br />  The basic
  connectives, such as <tt>+</tt>, <tt>*</tt>, <tt>&lt;=</tt> and so
  forth, are regular functions that the user can freely define.  For
  instance <tt>Person.'&lt;' = function (rhs) { name &lt;
  rhs.name </tt>} define the <tt>&lt;</tt> between <tt>Person</tt>.
</li>

<li>Objects can be arbitrarily nested.<br />  The previous limitations
  of the language are alleviated, and the
  <tt>.</tt> connective can now be freely used.  For instance:
<code>
robot.leg("rear-left").joint("knee").value
</code>
</li>


<li>Name spaces.<br />
<p>
  There is no global name space in the Urbi language: there are no
  global variables or functions in the traditional sense.  Rather,
  the Urbi world is a network of objects that use each other (either
  via inheritance, or via aggregation).  To reach a particular
  object, for instance <tt>Object</tt> from which all the objects
  derive, one uses a series of local names starting from the current
  object.
</p>
  <p>
    For instance <tt>true</tt> is defined as a member of
    <tt>Object.Constants</tt>, which is a prototype of <tt>Object</tt> (i.e.,
    <tt>Object</tt> "derives" from <tt>Object.Constants</tt>.  Since every
    object derives from <tt>Object</tt>, the <tt>true</tt> is available from
    anywhere.
  </p>
</li>



<li>Lobbies.<br />
<p>
  Sessions with the Urbi server, via files or via network
  connections, are handled via "lobbies".  Lobbies implement the
  local scope: variables introduced during the interaction are
  only visible from this lobby.  Nevertheless, because lobbies are
  connected to the rest of the Urbi network of objects, the user can
  introduce new features in the common space, for instance by
  extending <tt>Object</tt>.  The user may also provide access to
  his/her own lobby by giving it a name in an object that is
  reachable from the other lobbies.
</p>
</li>


<li>An object can have any number of prototypes.<br />
  Multiple inheritance is fully supported.  This allows to factor
  common code.  For instance the object <tt>Orderable</tt> provides
  implementations of ordered comparators in terms of each other
  (e.g., <tt>function '&gt;=' (rhs) { rhs &lt; self </tt>}), and
  <tt>Comparable</tt> relates <tt>==</tt> and <tt>!=</tt>.  If your
  <tt>object</tt> provides <tt>==</tt> and <tt>&lt;</tt>, then running
  <tt>object.addProto(Comparable);object.addProto(Orderable);</tt>
  provides the others.
</li>
</ul>
