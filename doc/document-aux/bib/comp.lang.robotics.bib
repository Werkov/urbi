  abstract =	 {La programmation automatique des robots est un des
                  grands axes de la recherche en robotique. Dans ce
                  cadre, les membres du LIFIA ont développé SHARP. Ce
                  logiciel fournit à partir de la description de la
                  tâche à réaliser et de la géométrie des objets à
                  manipuler, le plan d'actions permettant de réaliser
                  le montage. Ce plan d'actions est écrit en LM-OBJ
                  (Langage de Manipulation de niveau OBJet). Le
                  travail présenté dans ce mémoire est la conception
                  et la réalisation de l'interpréteur de LM-OBJ,
                  permettant de faire exécuter par le robot les plans
                  d'actions fournis par SHARP. Après avoir exposé
                  comment se situe notre approche par rapport à celle
                  plus classique des langages de manipulation
                  (position relative entre deux objets plutôt que
                  position absolue dans l'espace de travail en termes
                  de repères cartésiens), nous décrivons les
                  différentes instructions du langage : déplacements,
                  saisies et lâchers d'objets, réalisation de
                  contacts\ldots Afin de bien situer la place de
                  LM-OBJ dans un logiciel de programmation automatique
                  comme SHARP, nous exposons les réalisations
                  antérieures dans le cadre de SHARP (planificateur,
                  LM, fonctions amnistiantes). La structure de la base
                  de données, comprenant notamment la description
                  géométrique des objets à manipuler, est exposée en
                  détail. Nous présentons les diverses solutions
                  envisagées permettant de traduire une instruction
                  LM-OBJ en une commande exécutable par le robot (en
                  terme de repère déplaçable et de transformation
                  géométrique à lui appliquer). Nous exposons comment
                  les contacts sont réalisés à l'aide d'un capteur de
                  forces afin d'exécuter des mouvements fins
                  d'assemblage.},

  abstract =     {Guido van Robot is a minimalistic programming
                  language providing just enough syntax to help
                  students learn the concepts of sequencing,
                  conditional branching, looping and procedural
                  abstraction. Its biggest strength is that it permits
                  this learning in an environment that combines the
                  thrill of problem-solving with instant visual
                  feedback. In short, it is an interactive,
                  introductory programming language that is excellent
                  for learning the basic concepts of programming,
                  applicable in any high-level language. Best of all,
                  it's a whole lot of fun, too!  At this point, you
                  are probably asking yourself, What is GvR,
                  specifically? The gist of it is that it is a robot
                  represented by a triangle on the screen that moves
                  around in a world made up of streets and avenues,
                  walls and beepers, which Guido can collect or
                  set. His actions are completely guided by a program
                  written by the user.  One other item of interest
                  about GvR is that it is a student-created
                  project. GvR was initially written by students at
                  Yorktown High School in Arlington, Virginia, with
                  the help of professional programmers serving as
                  mentors. You can navigate to the History page to
                  learn more about this part of the project.},
  note =         {This is a toy language very much like Logo.  A robot
                  is displayed on the screen in a flat 2d view, and
                  you can move it around in a Python-like programming
                  language.  Nothing about concurrency, a really poor
                  language written as a student project.  But maybe
                  some ideas can be used for an interactive
                  environment to toy with Urbi.},

                  high-level agent control based on concurrent program
                  execution is considered. A formal definition in the
                  situation calculus of such a programming language is
                  presented and illustrated with some examples. The
                  language includes facilities for prioritizing the
                  execution of con- current processes, interrupting
                  the execution when certain conditions become true,
                  and dealing with exogenous actions. The language
                  differs from other procedural for- malisms for
                  concurrency in that the initial state can be
                  incompletely specified and the primitive actions can
                  be user-defined by axioms in the situation
                  calculus. Some mathematical properties of the
                  language are proven, for instance, that the proposed
                  semantics is equivalent to that given earlier for
                  the portion of the language without concurrency.},

                  FROB to model other programming architectures, and
                  we compare it's capabilities to other extant
                  languages that are reviewed.},

  abstract =     {We have applied methodologies developed for
                  domain-specific embedded languages to create a
                  high-level robot control language called Frob, for
                  Functional Robotics. Frob supports a programming
                  style that cleanly separates the what from the how
                  of a robotic control program. That is, the what is a
                  simple, easily understood definition of the control
                  strategy using groups of equations and primitives
                  which combine sets of these control system equations
                  into a complex system. The how aspect of the program
                  addresses the unpleasant details, such as the method
                  used to realize these equations, the connection
                  between the control equations and the sensors and
                  effectors in the robot, and communication with other
                  elements of the system. Frob is a system that
                  supports rapid prototyping of new control
                  strategies, enables software reuse through
                  composition, and defines a system in a way that can
                  be formally reasoned about and transformed.}
