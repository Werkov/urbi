  title = {Towards {JIT} compilation for {IO} language},

  abstract = {{IO} is a relatively new pure object-oriented language,
                  providing dynamic features comparable with popular
                  scripting languages like Python or Ruby. {IO} has simple
                  but flexible syntax, allowing for metaprogramming at the
                  syntax tree level. Some aspects of the syntax, such as
                  operator and assignment reshuffling, make {IO} source code
                  feel natural. Availability of runtime code modification
                  and simple grammar makes {IO} a good choice as a dynamic
                  programming language research vehicle.  In this work we
                  describe our approach to dynamic compilation of programs
                  in {IO.} Inline caching and speculative inlining provide
                  high performance benefits if the program behavior is
                  stable. We explore programs with multiple or alternating
                  behaviors, and propose multiversion speculative inlining
                  with fine-grained invalidation.},
