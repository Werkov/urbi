  abstract =     {This article advocates the revival of coroutines as
                  a convenient general control abstraction. After
                  proposing a new classification of coroutines, we
                  introduce the concept of full asymmetric coroutines
                  and provide a precise definition for it through an
                  operational semantics. We then demonstrate that full
                  coroutines have an expressive power equivalent to
                  one-shot continuations and one-shot delimited
                  continuations. We also show that full asymmetric
                  coroutines and one-shot delimited continuations have
                  many similarities, and therefore present comparable
                  benefits. Nevertheless, coroutines are easier
                  implemented and understood, especially in the realm
                  of procedural languages.}
