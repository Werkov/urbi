* configuration
--enable-host=URBI-HOST
--enable-env=URBI-ENV
--with-openr[=sdk-path]

This package builds a single kernel (libkernel).  If you pass
--with-openr, this library will use the openr communication parts,
otherwise the bsdnet bits are used.

Note that pass --with-openr does not change the URBI-ENV name, so to
compile (and install) for Aibo, you should probably run

    ./configure --with-openr --host=mipsel-openr --enable-env=aibo

* test suite
To run the test suite, run make check (-j2 works).  In the build
directory of the test suite (e.g., _build/linux/tests) there is a
test-suite.log file which contains all the details.
