* Remove useless ast::
In the visitors, the node are qualified by ast::, although they
live in the same namespace.  This is needed for tc, but not for
Urbi.  We need more parameters about the namespaces.

* Graph generation
There are some hard coded values (e.g. Escapable).

* Docs
Don't duplicate the final periods.
