This is how to install urbi dependencies on Debian and Ubuntu.
First add the following line to your /etc/apt/sources.list file:

deb file:/<urbi_kernel_sources_path>/share/debian ./

Then update your repositories (as root), and install urbi-deps:

$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install urbi-deps

Makefile is only provided for the sole purpose of building urbi-deps*.deb and
the corresponding Packages.gz (needed by apt).
