INSTALL Notes
-------------

The kernel is written in standard C++ and should not be a problem
for most compilers available, even on some exotic robot plateforms :)

WARNING: You need to install bison and flex before compiling the kernel.
The versions that work are the following:

    - flex 2.5.4a
    - bison 1.875d

Any other version might (and probably will) not work.
We have plans to write our own parser or to use more modern alternatives
to flex/bison but for the moment, that's the way it is.

The Makefile also uses 'sed', but it should be available on any respectable
environment ;)
