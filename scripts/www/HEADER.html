      </div>

      <h2>Package Types</h2>
      <div class="section">
	<p>
	  There are three kinds of packages:
	  <dl>
	    <dt>Urbi SDK (urbi-sdk-*)</dt>
	    <dd>The full Software Development Kit, including the
	      full documentation in HTML and PDF.  These packages
	      are made for computers on which applications are
	      developed.</dd>
	    <dt>Urbi Runtime (urbi-runtime-*)</dt>
	    <dd>Only what is needed to run Urbi programs.  These
	      packages are made for robots running these
	      applications.  They do not contain the
	      documentation.</dd>
	    <dt>Urbi Documentation (urbi-doc-*)</dt>
	    <dd>The whole documentation, in HTML and PDF.</dd>
	  </dl>
	</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Architectures</h2>
      <div class="section">
	<h3>Source</h3>
	<div class="section">
	  <p>
	    The files with no architecture specified are BZip2
	    source tarballs
	    (<a href="urbi-sdk-2.7.5.tar.bz2">urbi-sdk-2.7.5.tar.bz2</a>).
	    Use them only if you are ready to compile Urbi SDK
	    yourself.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<h3>Unix</h3>
	<div class="section">
	  <p>
	    GNU/Linux and Mac OS X packages are regular BZip2 tarballs.
	  </p>
	</div>

	<h3>Windows</h3>
	<div class="section">
	  <p>
	    The packages depend on the version of Visual C++ you
	    use: 2005 or 2008.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Windows packages in "*.exe" contain an installer that
	    installs both debug and release libraries, an UObject
	    wizard for Visual C++, Gostai Editor and Gostai
	    Console.  Using the installers is strongly
	    recommended.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    If you know what you are doing, you might want to use
	    the "*.zip" files.  They come in two flavors: debug or
	    release.  They require that you have MS Visual C++
	    installed, or that you run "vcredist.exe" that can be
	    found <a href="http://www.gostai.com/downloads/urbi/windows/">
	      here</a>.
