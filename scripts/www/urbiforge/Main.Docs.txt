!!Documentation for Urbi 2.x (latest release)

The main document, the Urbi SDK Manual, comes in two flavors.  Either
a single PDF file, or a set of HTML files.

* [[http://www.gostai.com/downloads/urbi/2.x/doc/urbi-sdk.pdf | Documentation in PDF]]

  The full, self-contained, documentation about Urbi SDK.

* [[http://www.gostai.com/downloads/urbi/doc/| Documentation as set of HTML pages]]

::[[http://www.gostai.com/downloads/urbi/doc/introduction.html|Introduction]]:Introduces Urbi SDK, the UObject middleware and the urbiscript language.

  Provides the table of contents of the whole documentation.
  See also the [[http://www.gostai.com/downloads/urbi/doc/index.html|index]].

::[[http://www.gostai.com/downloads/urbi/doc/urbiscript-user-manual.html|urbiscript User Manual]]:
  The "urbiscript tutorial": how to program in urbiscript.  It goes
  from the basis to concurrent and event-based programming.  No
  specific knowledge is expected.  There is no need for a C++
  compiler, as UObject will not be covered here.  The
  [[http://www.gostai.com/downloads/urbi/doc/urbi-sdk-reference-manual.html|Urbi Reference Manual]] contains a terse and complete definition of the Urbi
  environment.

::[[http://www.gostai.com/downloads/urbi/doc/uobjects.html|UObjects Manual]]:
  The Urbi architecture: its core components (client/server
  architecture), how its middleware works, how to include extensions
  as UObjects (C++ components) and so forth.
  No knowledge of the urbiscript language is needed.  As a matter of
  fact, Urbi can be used as a standalone middleware architecture to
  orchestrate the execution of existing components.
  Yet urbiscript is a feature that "comes for free": it is easy
  using it to experiment, prototype, and even program fully-featured
  applications that orchestrate native components.  The interested
  reader should read either the
  [[http://www.gostai.com/downloads/urbi/doc/urbiscript-user-manual.html|urbiscript user Manual]], or the
  [[http://www.gostai.com/downloads/urbi/doc/urbiscript-language-reference-manual.html|urbiscript reference manual]].

::[[http://www.gostai.com/downloads/urbi/doc/faq.html|Frequently Asked Questions]]:
  Answers to common questions about Urbi, UObjects, and urbiscript.

::[[http://www.gostai.com/downloads/urbi/doc/urbi-sdk-reference-manual.html|Urbi Reference Manual]]:
  The specifications of urbiscript.  Its syntax, semantics, standard
  library, and SDK.  Refer to this section to check whether some code
  is valid, or simply browse the urbiscript or C++ APIs for a desired
  feature.  Random reading can also provide you with advanced
  knowledge or subtleties about some urbiscript aspects.

  This part is not a tutorial; it is not structured in a progressive
  manner and is too detailed.  Think of it as a dictionary: one does
  not learn a foreign language by reading a dictionary.  For a
  tutorial, see the
  [[http://www.gostai.com/downloads/urbi/doc/urbiscript-user-manual.html|urbiscript User Manual]].

  This part does not aim at giving advanced programming techniques. Its
  only goal is to define the language and its libraries.

::[[http://www.gostai.com/downloads/urbi/doc/release-notes.html|Release Notes]]:
  This document (also known as the Urbi ChangeLog, or Urbi
  NEWS) lists the user-visible changes in Urbi SDK releases.

::[[http://www.gostai.com/downloads/urbi/doc/urbi-platforms.html|Platforms]]:
  This part covers the specific features of Urbi for some of the
  platforms it was ported to:
