<h1>Urbi SDK 2.3</h1>

<h2>Package Types</h2>
<p>
  There are two kinds of packages:
  <dl>
    <dt>urbi-sdk-*</dt>
    <dd>They contain the full Software Development Kit.  They are made
    for computers on which applications are developed.</dd>
    <dt>urbi-runtime-*</dt>
    <dd>They contain only what is needed to run Urbi programs.  They
    are made for robots on which these applications run.</dd>
  </dl>
</p>

<h2>Architectures</h2>
<h3>Unix</h3>
<p>
  GNU/Linux and Mac OS X packages are regular BZip2 tarballs.
</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>
  Note that packages depend upon the version of Visual C++ you intend
  to use: 2005 or 2008.
</p>

<p>
  Windows packages in "*.exe" contain an installer that install both
  debug and release libraries, an UObject wizard for Visual C++,
  Gostai Editor and Gostai Console.  Using the installers is strongly
  recommended.
</p>

<p>
  But if you really know what you are doing, you might want to use the
  "*.zip" files.  They come in two flavors: debug or release.  They
  require that you have MS Visual C++ installed, or that you run
  "vcredist.exe".
