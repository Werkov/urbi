<h1>Urbi 2.4</h1>

<h2>Package Types</h2>
<p>
  There are two kinds of packages:
  <dl>
    <dt>Urbi SDK (urbi-sdk-*)</dt>
    <dd>They contain the full Software Development Kit.  They are made
      for computers on which applications are developed.</dd>
    <dt>Urbi Runtime (urbi-runtime-*)</dt>
    <dd>They contain only what is needed to run Urbi programs.  They
      are made for robots on which these applications run.</dd>
  </dl>
</p>

<h2>Architectures</h2>
<h3>Source</h3>
<p>
  The files with no architecture specified are BZip2 source tarballs
  (<a href="urbi-sdk-2.4.tar.bz2">urbi-sdk-2.4.tar.bz2</a>).
  Use them only if you are ready to compile Urbi SDK yourself.
<h3>Unix</h3>
<p>
  GNU/Linux and Mac OS X packages are regular BZip2 tarballs.
</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>
  The packages depend on the version of Visual C++ you
  use: 2005 or 2008.
</p>

<p>
  Windows packages in "*.exe" contain an installer that installs both
  debug and release libraries, an UObject wizard for Visual C++,
  Gostai Editor and Gostai Console.  Using the installers is strongly
  recommended.
</p>

<p>
  If you know what you are doing, you might want to use the "*.zip"
  files.  They come in two flavors: debug or release.  They require
  that you have MS Visual C++ installed, or that you run
  "vcredist.exe" that can be
  found <a href="http://www.gostai.com/downloads/urbi/windows/">
  here</a>.
