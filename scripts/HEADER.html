<h2>What's new</h2>
<p>
  This release was focused on improving runtime performances, and
  addressing bugs.  We expect users to find some significant
  improvements.
</p>

<p>
  It also provides some new features such as (strict) variadic
  functions.  For instance:

<pre>
  function variadic(var a1, var a2, var a3, var args[])
  {
    echo("a1 = %s, a2 = %s, a3 = %s, args = %s"
         % [a1, a2, a3, args]);
  }|
  variadic(1, 2, 3);
  [00000002] *** a1 = 1, a2 = 2, a3 = 3, args = []
  variadic(1, 2, 3, 4);
  [00000002] *** a1 = 1, a2 = 2, a3 = 3, args = [4]
  variadic(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
  [00000002] *** a1 = 1, a2 = 2, a3 = 3, args = [4, 5]
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Package Types</h2>
<p>
  There are three kinds of packages:
  <dl>
    <dt>Urbi SDK (urbi-sdk-*)</dt>
    <dd>The full Software Development Kit, including the full
      documentation in HTML and PDF.  These packages are made for
      computers on which applications are developed.</dd>
    <dt>Urbi Runtime (urbi-runtime-*)</dt>
    <dd>Only what is needed to run Urbi programs.  These packages are
      made for robots running these applications.  They do not contain
      the documentation.</dd>
    <dt>Urbi documentation (urbi-doc-*)</dt>
    <dd>The whole documentation, in HTML and PDF.</dd>
  </dl>
</p>

<h2>Architectures</h2>
<h3>Source</h3>
<p>
  The files with no architecture specified are BZip2 source tarballs
  (<a href="urbi-sdk-2.6.tar.bz2">urbi-sdk-2.6.tar.bz2</a>).
  Use them only if you are ready to compile Urbi SDK yourself.
<h3>Unix</h3>
<p>
  GNU/Linux and Mac OS X packages are regular BZip2 tarballs.
</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>
  The packages depend on the version of Visual C++ you
  use: 2005 or 2008.
</p>

<p>
  Windows packages in "*.exe" contain an installer that installs both
  debug and release libraries, an UObject wizard for Visual C++,
  Gostai Editor and Gostai Console.  Using the installers is strongly
  recommended.
</p>

<p>
  If you know what you are doing, you might want to use the "*.zip"
  files.  They come in two flavors: debug or release.  They require
  that you have MS Visual C++ installed, or that you run
  "vcredist.exe" that can be
  found <a href="http://www.gostai.com/downloads/urbi/windows/">
  here</a>.
