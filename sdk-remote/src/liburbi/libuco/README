This convenience library contains code that is used both by
kernel/libuobject and liburbi/libuobject.  (Yes, there are two
different libuobject, ask MN for details.)

We used to use the same sources twice, which was quite a PITA: two
compilations, and more importantly, a terrible headache to try to
factor the Makefile snippets.  It turned out to be virtually
impossible to share the Makefile snippets while trying to get rid of
recursive Makefiles in SDK-Remote.

The name is a contraction of library uobject-common.
