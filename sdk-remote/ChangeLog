2005-10-24
	Added support for URBI list type.
2005-10-14

2005-09-30
	Included liburbi-openr support.
	Corrected an unitialized-variable bug in uabstractclient.h.
2005-09-19

	ostream interface now uses the fixed floating point format as it should
2005-09-12
	Added a fast mode for Monitor object, activated by default, disabling the shared display mode.
2005-09-07
	UAbstractClient inherits from ostream, the operator << can be used to send commands
	Defined a URBI macro allowing to do URBI((headPan.val = 12;)) ; see doc
	Updated doc accordingly
	Updated examples to match changes in syntax for 0.9.6b

2005-06-07
	Corrected a few bugs in UMessage manipulation functions.
	Corrected a potential buffer overrun in sendCommand

2005-04-11
	Rewrote template callback mecanism. Old functions kept for compatibility

2005-01-13
	Modified Move.cpp: it does not send all the execs at the same time anymore.
	Parser now ignores blank line without any warning.

2005-01-06
	Windows version of liburbi, with vc++ projects and solutions.
	All examples compile under windows.

2004-12-22
	Corrected a memory leak in UMessage destructor.
	More documentation.
	Added noop after every camera format change.

2004-12-21
	Updated the interrupt behavior of Move. It now work as it should.

2004-12-20
	Rewrote urbiimage to have more friendly command line arguments
	Rewrote sendSound to use URBI "speaker.remain" as the timing method.

2004-10-29

2004-10-13
	Some work on the documentation.
	Renamed errorNotify in printf.
	Removed all use of the pack functions from the examples.

2004-10-12
	Important modifications to update to the 1.0 URBI protocol.
	Added a UMessage structure containing all informations related to an URBI message: the library now goes one step further in parsing the server messages.
	Added the associated USound and UImage structures.
	Added a convert function for sound conversion.
	Added template versions of setCallback to set a callback on member functions.
	Ported all the examples to the new syntax.

	sendSound now copies the buffer given in parameters.

2004-07-28

2004-07-12
	Added possibility to set window title in monitor's constructor.

	Major rewrite to ease other implementations: moved command code in UAbstractClient interface. API is mostly unchanged.


==LastOf-0-2==

2004-06-29
	Added a reconnection attempt after a small usleep in UClient constructor (ipstack design flaw)

2004-06-23
	Added support for stdin in urbisound and stdout in urbisendsound
	To pipe them one need to do:
	urbisound 100000 gyges - | sox -t raw -r 16000 -w -c 2 -s - -t raw -r 16000 -w -c 1 -s - | urbisendsound nemes -
	added urbitalkie in examples, it realizes this pipe. Doesn't work very well.

2004-06-18

2004-06-14
	Changed listLock mutex to recursive mode.
	Added missing lock/unlock calls around UCallbackList::call

2004-06-09
	New algorithm for the Move object: the sequence choosen is now the shortest that reach a value within the precision given as a parameter.
	Added correct path handling in Move.
	Updated urbiwalk accordingly.
	Modified turn samples: left and right turn are now symetric.
