UObject API
-----------

* If you create a UNotifyChange on a UVar and if you change the type of the
UVar, the UNotifyChange stops functioning.

By example, create a UNotifyChange on the UVar val of the test UObject,
and then try:

  test.val = "any string";     ==> UNotifyChange actived (type string)
  test.val = "another string"; ==> UNotifyChange actived (type string)
  test.val = 1;                ==> UNotifyChange desactived (type int)
  test.val = "again a string"; ==> UNotifyChange still desactived
