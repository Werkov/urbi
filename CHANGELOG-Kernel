* bugfix: fixed problem with assignment result just after a blend[mix]


--------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 0.9.3                         released on 23.02.2005
--------------------------------------------------------------

* bugfix: "valn" evaluation doesn't change the "val" value anymore
* bugfix: type mismatch with binary variables is correctly handled
* bugfix: tags on grouped commands (between { }) are now working
* feature: functions are now implemented (in a limited extend, see doc)
* feature: the keyword "def" alone lists the existing function definitions
* feature: "undef <functionname>" can be used to undefine a function
* feature: "isdef(variable)" returns 1 or 0, if the variable is defined or not
* feature: arrays can now be indexed with strings and not only numbers
* modif: the $() operator will now add a connectionID when no prefix is given for the variable, making it local to the connection.
* bugfix: +report flag now works fine with grouped commands (between { })
* feature: +timeout and +condout flags added
* feature: added the 'getphase' modificator


--------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 0.9.4                         released on 05.05.2005
--------------------------------------------------------------

* modif: the target value of a sin-modified assignment is constantly reevaluated during execution, not only at start.
* bugfix: grouped commands without tag are not labelled "notag" anymore, but __UGrouped_set_of_commands__
* modif: Error messages are now prefixed by !!! and simple system messages by ***
* feature: atan function added
* modif: sin assignments don't require the variable to be already defined anymore. It's just a "normal" assignment.


--------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 0.9.5                         released on 24.07.2005
--------------------------------------------------------------

Major kernel code revision for variable storage and access. Caching mechanism implemented. Various perfomance optimization.

* modif: Aliases are now traced once when a command is executed, so dynamic modification of aliases chains will not affect already running code. This is done for optimization purposes. 
* feature: function 'abs' added
* feature: global.ghostID variable added: it returns the ID of the ghost connection
* feature: function cpuload() added and a warning is issued when cpuload > 120% for more than 10 iterations of the work loop
* modif: variable access caching system is functional
* bugfix: fixed some bug for the propagation of "stop" commands in the command tree (now: only !UONQUEUE commands affected).
* modif: the way the group hiearchy is passed has changed: group a {b,c};a.x=0 time:10; will not generate errors on a.x anymore. Only leaves are taken into account for error report (this is a subtle problem, but you will be happy it is solved).
* bugfix: prefixes are now ignored for system functions like "sin", "string", "cos",... This make toto.sin(2); a valid evaluation (it's very permissive) but solve a known bug with cross client function definitions.
* bugfix: no more spasm-like shake after a motoron when the joints have moved.


--------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 0.9.6                         released on 03.09.2005
--------------------------------------------------------------

Some syntax changes:
  - valn is replaced by val'n. Any variable can now be accessed in a normalized form by using the 'n suffix. Other suffixes will be available in the future, extending the possibilities (average on a time frame, max/min, etc).
  - blend modes, ranges and speedmin/max are now set/read with variable "properties", which are accessed via the -> indirection:
      variable->blend = mix; // instead of blend[mix] variable
      variable->rangemin = 45;
      variable->rangemax;
      variable->speedmin = 15;
      variable->speedmax = 10;
      variable->unit = "cm";
  - the "delta" property is accessible for variables: variable->delta = ... This property set the level of tolerance when adaptive trajectory are executed. Basically, it means that the assignment "variable = x" will be done with a precision of +/- variable->delta. For normal variables, the delta is zero. For variables related to motor devices, it reflects the precision of the underlying hardware.
  - global.motortolerance and global.errorsensibility no longer exist and they are replaced by the corresponding joint.val delta property. Note that this property, like any property, can be assigned using a group assignment. For example: robot.val->delta = ...
  - the "delete" operator is replaced by "undef" which is now common for variables and functions. If both a variable and a function share the same name "x", "undef x" will delete the function first.
  - the isdef function now works with variables *and* functions.
  - camera.ballx, camera.bally and camera.ballsize are replaced by ball.x, ball.y and ball.size. This is in prevision of future soft devices semantics.
  - global.name, global.device[i], global.nbdevices are replaced by robot.name, robot.device[i] and robot.nbdevices for semantic consistancy.
  - the +condout flag is changed into +stopif, for consistancy with the new +blockif flag

* bugfix: +report now works fine with function calls
* modif: "def f(x) instruction;" is now valid if instruction is alone (no brackets needed). Otherwise, brackets must be used to enclose several commands, like: "def f(x) {x;x+1};" 
* modif array indexes are now "auto-static". There is no need to use the tab[:i] construct in a loop. tab[i] has the same effect. This is to simplify the syntax, considering that array indexes would probably never need to be non-static.
* feature: def is now working with variables. "def my.var" defines my.var, without a type. "def {x;y;z}" defines x,y and z in one shot. "def mydevice {a;b}" defines mydevice.a and mydevice.b in one shot. The interest of this feature is to use the "defchekon" command to make the interpreter strict about undefined assignments (reject it). "defcheckoff" returns to the default permissive policy.
* feature: the 'e extension is available: it gives the difference between estimated value and measured value for a device, which is a crude measure of the force/torque for a motor device.
* modif: "delayed" motor messages no longer exist. They can be emulated trivially with: whenever (device.val'e > device.val->delta) echo "*** delayed";
* modif: speedmax enforcement is now very strict and works. You can restrict any motor device "d" with: d.val->speedmax = ... (units/s)
* bugfix: load and exec now work as expected, they actually insert the code where the command is called (and not at the end of the execution buffer)
* feature: for any variable the ' and '' extensions are now available to return the derivative and the second derivative. The value used is the theoretical motion profile as expressed by the currently running assignments. For the real derivative and second derivative, measured from the sensor output, the 'd and 'dd extensions are available.
* bugfix: tags for grouped commands that include background commands now work (like tag:{at ...})
* feature: the +blockif(test) flag is now available and the command is blocked when the test is true, unblocked when it is false.
* bugfix: "loop {noop}" and "loop noop" now run the same, without having a double execution time difference
* bugfix: the FOR command morphing policy has been changed to a more semantically valid version


--------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 0.9.6b                       released on 07.09.2005
--------------------------------------------------------------

* modif: tests are now expressions, like in C. You can write stuffs like "while (1) ..."
* modif: the wait command is not polymorphic anymore. Use "wait(t)" to wait a certain time and "waituntil(test)" for a condition
* the "main" device is now called "global" again. The main device affects: global.name, global.device[i] and global.nbdevices, global.epsilontilde, global.epsilonpercent, global.ghostID. This name is subject to another change in the future, as it should better reflect the notion of "superdevice".
* robot.epsilontilde and robotl.epsilonpercent are now again global.epsilontilde and global.epsilonpercent for consistancy.
* function "booleval" no longer exists
* bugfix: the >= operator now works fine
* bugfix: operator precedence in tests has been fixed
* bugfix: function local variables are now correctly freed at the end of the function call
* bugfix: bug with undef instabilities now fixed
* bugfix: memory leak on tests is fixed
* bugfix: the stop command now works better, in particular inside nested loops. stop/freeze/block are now taking one cycle to execute (they are no more ZTEC: Zero Time Execution Commands).
* modif: global.device[i] and global.joint[i] are now aliases pointing to the corresponding device.val variable, instead of strings with the device name. The old string value can now be accessed with global.devicename[i] and global.jointname[i]. This serves the most common usage of such shortcuts and save the trouble of understanding the $(...) operator for most users. 
* modif: the std.u file has been modified: robot.leg aliases are now global.leg
* modif: robot.ledMode is now global.ledMode
* feature: a new =~= comparison operator is available: it takes into accound the delta property of variables to perform a ~= comparison. Very useful to put tests on motor values. It is also better than the "global.epsilontilde + ~=" approach because it is device specific. Delta composition for complex expressions will be added soon. 
* feature: the ghost connection now outputs its messages to the debug port (59000)
* modif: better cpuload() measure
* bugfix: fixed precedence between ; and ,
* feature: stopall command clears all commands in every connection. It is very powerful and should be used carefuly.
* bugfix: fixed "exec" command bug occuring in conjunction with "stop"


--------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 0.9.6c                       released on 09.09.2005
--------------------------------------------------------------

* bugfix: URBI.INI was not properly read at each robot start, on a random basis. It's fixed.


--------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 0.9.7                        released on 29.10.2005
--------------------------------------------------------------

Major changes in the kernel interface to allow softdevices to be plugged in the kernel

* bugfix: memoryleak on +timeout flag is fixed
* feature: the command "connections;" returns a list of opened connections
* feature: new flag: "+connection("U1234566") : command" starts the command in the given connection. Can also be used with "all" as a parameter (starts in every connection) or "other" (starts in every connection except the current one). You can create a chat room with this:  myname+connection("other"):echo "hello!";
* feature: .val is now optional with devices and virtual devices. headPan.val is equivalent to headPan. Makes the code simpler.
* change: ball.x and ball.y are now centered between -1/2 and 1/2, avoiding the unecessary translation
* feature: event integrated, emit is available (see doc for full description)
* feature: added 'loadwav' function
* bugfix: multiple flags are now handled properly
* feature: +bg flag added 
* bugfix: softtest in functions are now handled properly
* feature: time values can now be expressed as a combination of d,h,m,s,ms
* feature: new "every (time) ..." command
* feature: the "reset" command now virtually reboot your robot, so that you can reload scripts and test modifications easily
* feature: the "undefall" command clear all user defined variables and functions
* feature: list type is now available: [1,2,"bla",14]. You can iterate a list L with the foreach command: foreach i in L {...};
* bugfix: 'n now works with virtual devices
* change: motoron and motoroff are now changed to "motor on" and "motor off", to prepare the way for future deivce control mechanisms. You also have the "motor switch" command to change from on to off and vice-versa.
* bugfix: operator priority in tests is now fixed
* feature: echo can now have a connection modifier to specify a connection where the message is displayed: echo "..." connection:ID. ID can be "all" or "other" or a specific connection ID.
* feature: partial test evaluation occurs now when (false && b) or (true || b) is calculated (b is not evaluated)
* bugfix: at memory leak from 0.9.7  now fixed
* bugfix: $(...) inside function now works properly
* feature: prefixing variables with "local" make then explicitely local to the connection, which is useful inside functions to access local variables.
* modif: static variables are now prefixed by @. The keyword 'only' as a prefix is used where @ was before, to signal a non recursive descent in a virtual device expression.
* added: sgn(x) function
* change: the timeout modifier no longer exist because of conflicts with the new 'timeout' command.
